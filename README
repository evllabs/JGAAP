To run JGAAP in Windows, click on the jgaap.jar file in the bin directory.

On Unix-based systems, or from the Windows command-line, you can also run:

java -jar jgaap.jar

NOTE: It is suggested that you increase the Heap size alloted to the JVM 
     when using JGAAP since it is very memory intensive. 2GB is good for 
     most applications.

java -Xmx2048m -jar jgaap.jar

from the bin directory.


JGAAP also has a command line mode.  You can see the command 
line options by running:

java -jar jgaap.jar -h
or
java -jar jgaap.jar --help


JGAAP also comes with a ant build file in the src directory.

ant build

ant run-gui
