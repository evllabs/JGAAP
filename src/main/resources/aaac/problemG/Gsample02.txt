 
 
I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to
me, or to any other.  I may credit the seductive influence
of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it,
and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed
for the balance of the strange tale.
 
When my convivial host discovered that he had told me so
much, and that I was prone to doubtfulness, his foolish pride
assumed the task the old vintage had commenced, and so he
unearthed written evidence in the form of musty manuscript,
and dry official records of the British Colonial Office to support
many of the salient features of his remarkable narrative.
 
I do not say the story is true, for I did not witness the
happenings which it portrays, but the fact that in the telling
of it to you I have taken fictitious names for the principal
characters quite sufficiently evidences the sincerity of my own
belief that it MAY be true.
 
The yellow, mildewed pages of the diary of a man long dead, and
the records of the Colonial Office dovetail perfectly with the
narrative of my convivial host, and so I give you the story as
I painstakingly pieced it out from these several various agencies.
 
If you do not find it credible you will at least be as one
with me in acknowledging that it is unique, remarkable, and
interesting.
 
From the records of the Colonial Office and from the dead
man's diary we learn that a certain young English nobleman,
whom we shall call John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, was
commissioned to make a peculiarly delicate investigation of
conditions in a British West Coast African Colony from whose
simple native inhabitants another European power was
known to be recruiting soldiers for its native army, which it
used solely for the forcible collection of rubber and ivory
from the savage tribes along the Congo and the Aruwimi.
The natives of the British Colony complained that many of
their young men were enticed away through the medium of
fair and glowing promises, but that few if any ever returned
to their families.
 
The Englishmen in Africa went even further, saying that
these poor blacks were held in virtual slavery, since after
their terms of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed
upon by their white officers, and they were told that they had
yet several years to serve.
 
And so the Colonial Office appointed John Clayton to a new
post in British West Africa, but his confidential instructions
centered on a thorough investigation of the unfair treatment
of black British subjects by the officers of a friendly
European power.  Why he was sent, is, however, of little moment
to this story, for he never made an investigation, nor,
in fact, did he ever reach his destination.
 
Clayton was the type of Englishman that one likes best to
associate with the noblest monuments of historic achievement
upon a thousand victorious battlefields--a strong, virile man
--mentally, morally, and physically.
 
In stature he was above the average height; his eyes were
gray, his features regular and strong; his carriage that of
perfect, robust health influenced by his years of army training.
 
Political ambition had caused him to seek transference
from the army to the Colonial Office and so we find him, still
young, entrusted with a delicate and important commission in
the service of the Queen.
 
When he received this appointment he was both elated and
appalled.  The preferment seemed to him in the nature of a
well-merited reward for painstaking and intelligent service,
and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and
responsibility; but, on the other hand, he had been married to
the Hon. Alice Rutherford for scarce a three months, and it
was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers
and isolation of tropical Africa that appalled him.
 
For her sake he would have refused the appointment, but she
would not have it so.  Instead she insisted that he accept,
and, indeed, take her with him.
 
There were mothers and brothers and sisters, and aunts
and cousins to express various opinions on the subject, but as
to what they severally advised history is silent.
 
We know only that on a bright May morning in 1888,
John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice sailed from Dover on
their way to Africa.
 
A month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered
a small sailing vessel, the Fuwalda, which was to bear
them to their final destination.
 
And here John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice, his wife,
vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men.
 
Two months after they weighed anchor and cleared from
the port of Freetown a half dozen British war vessels were
scouring the south Atlantic for trace of them or their little
vessel, and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was
found upon the shores of St. Helena which convinced the
world that the Fuwalda had gone down with all on board,
and hence the search was stopped ere it had scarce begun;
though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years.
 
The Fuwalda, a barkentine of about one hundred tons,
was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade
in the far southern Atlantic, their crews composed of
the offscourings of the sea--unhanged murderers and
cutthroats of every race and every nation.
 
The Fuwalda was no exception to the rule.  Her officers
were swarthy bullies, hating and hated by their crew.
The captain, while a competent seaman, was a brute in his
treatment of his men.  He knew, or at least he used, but two
arguments in his dealings with them--a belaying pin and a
revolver--nor is it likely that the motley aggregation
he signed would have understood aught else.
 
So it was that from the second day out from Freetown
John Clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the
deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed were never
enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.
 
It was on the morning of the second day that the first link
was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances
ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been
paralleled in the history of man.
 
Two sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda,
the first mate was on duty, and the captain had stopped to
speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.
 
The men were working backwards toward the little party
who were facing away from the sailors.  Closer and closer
they came, until one of them was directly behind the captain.
In another moment he would have passed by and this strange
narrative would never have been recorded.
 
But just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and
Lady Greystoke, and, as he did so, tripped against the sailor
and sprawled headlong upon the deck, overturning the water-
pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents.
 
For an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an instant.
With a volley of awful oaths, his face suffused with the
scarlet of mortification and rage, the captain regained his
feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck.
 
The man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of
the act was thus accentuated.  The other seaman, however,
was neither old nor small--a huge bear of a man, with fierce
black mustachios, and a great bull neck set between massive
shoulders.
 
As he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low
snarl, sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with
a single mighty blow.
 
From scarlet the officer's face went white, for this was mutiny;
and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal
career.  Without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from
his pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle
towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was
almost as quick, so that the bullet which was intended for the
sailor's heart lodged in the sailor's leg instead, for Lord
Greystoke had struck down the captain's arm as he had seen
the weapon flash in the sun.
 
Words passed between Clayton and the captain, the former
making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality
displayed toward the crew, nor would he countenance anything
further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained
passengers.
 
The captain was on the point of making an angry reply,
but, thinking better of it, turned on his heel and black and
scowling, strode aft.
 
He did not care to antagonize an English official, for the
Queen's mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could
appreciate, and which he feared--England's far-reaching navy.
 
The two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting
his wounded comrade to rise.  The big fellow, who was
known among his mates as Black Michael, tried his leg gingerly,
and, finding that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton
with a word of gruff thanks.
 
Though the fellow's tone was surly, his words were evidently
well meant.  Ere he had scarce finished his little speech he
had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the
very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation.
 
They did not see him again for several days, nor did the
captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he
was forced to speak to them.
 
They took their meals in his cabin, as they had before the
unfortunate occurrence; but the captain was careful to see
that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time.
 
The other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little
above the villainous crew they bullied, and were only too
glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished English
noble and his lady, so that the Claytons were left very much
to themselves.
 
This in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it
also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so
that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings
which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy.
 
There was in the whole atmosphere of the craft that undefinable
something which presages disaster.  Outwardly, to the
knowledge of the Claytons, all went on as before upon the
little vessel; but that there was an undertow leading them
toward some unknown danger both felt, though they did not
speak of it to each other.
 
On the second day after the wounding of Black Michael,
Clayton came on deck just in time to see the limp body of
one of the crew being carried below by four of his fellows
while the first mate, a heavy belaying pin in his hand, stood
glowering at the little party of sullen sailors.
 
Clayton asked no questions--he did not need to--and the
following day, as the great lines of a British battleship grew
out of the distant horizon, he half determined to demand that
he and Lady Alice be put aboard her, for his fears were
steadily increasing that nothing but harm could result from
remaining on the lowering, sullen Fuwalda.
 
Toward noon they were within speaking distance of the
British vessel, but when Clayton had nearly decided to ask
the captain to put them aboard her, the obvious ridiculousness
of such a request became suddenly apparent.  What reason
could he give the officer commanding her majesty's ship
for desiring to go back in the direction from which he had
just come!
 
What if he told them that two insubordinate seamen had
been roughly handled by their officers?  They would but laugh
in their sleeves and attribute his reason for wishing to leave
the ship to but one thing--cowardice.
 
John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, did not ask to be transferred
to the British man-of-war.  Late in the afternoon he saw
her upper works fade below the far horizon, but not before
he learned that which confirmed his greatest fears, and
caused him to curse the false pride which had restrained him
from seeking safety for his young wife a few short hours
before, when safety was within reach--a safety which was now
gone forever.
 
It was mid-afternoon that brought the little old sailor, who
had been felled by the captain a few days before, to where
Clayton and his wife stood by the ship's side watching the
ever diminishing outlines of the great battleship.  The old
fellow was polishing brasses, and as he came edging along until
close to Clayton he said, in an undertone:
 
"'Ell's to pay, sir, on this 'ere craft, an' mark my word for
it, sir.  'Ell's to pay."
 
"What do you mean, my good fellow?" asked Clayton.
 
"Wy, hasn't ye seen wats goin' on?  Hasn't ye 'eard that
devil's spawn of a capting an' is mates knockin' the bloomin'
lights outen 'arf the crew?
 
"Two busted 'eads yeste'day, an' three to-day.  Black
Michael's as good as new agin an' 'e's not the bully to
stand fer it, not 'e; an' mark my word for it, sir."
 
"You mean, my man, that the crew contemplates mutiny?"
asked Clayton.
 
"Mutiny!" exclaimed the old fellow.  "Mutiny!  They means
murder, sir, an' mark my word for it, sir."
 
"When?"
 
"Hit's comin', sir; hit's comin' but I'm not a-sayin' wen, an'
I've said too damned much now, but ye was a good sort
t'other day an' I thought it no more'n right to warn ye.  But
keep a still tongue in yer 'ead an' when ye 'ear shootin' git
below an' stay there.
 
"That's all, only keep a still tongue in yer 'ead, or they'll
put a pill between yer ribs, an' mark my word for it, sir," and
the old fellow went on with his polishing, which carried him
away from where the Claytons were standing.
 
"Deuced cheerful outlook, Alice," said Clayton.
 
"You should warn the captain at once, John.  Possibly the
trouble may yet be averted," she said.
 
"I suppose I should, but yet from purely selfish motives I
am almost prompted to `keep a still tongue in my 'ead.'
Whatever they do now they will spare us in recognition of
my stand for this fellow Black Michael, but should they find
that I had betrayed them there would be no mercy shown us, Alice."
 
"You have but one duty, John, and that lies in the interest
of vested authority.  If you do not warn the captain you are
as much a party to whatever follows as though you had helped
to plot and carry it out with your own head and hands."
 
"You do not understand, dear," replied Clayton.  "It is of
you I am thinking--there lies my first duty.  The captain has
brought this condition upon himself, so why then should I
risk subjecting my wife to unthinkable horrors in a probably
futile attempt to save him from his own brutal folly?  You
have no conception, dear, of what would follow were this
pack of cutthroats to gain control of the Fuwalda."
 
"Duty is duty, John, and no amount of sophistries may
change it.  I would be a poor wife for an English lord were I
to be responsible for his shirking a plain duty.  I realize the
danger which must follow, but I can face it with you."
 
"Have it as you will then, Alice," he answered, smiling.
"Maybe we are borrowing trouble.  While I do not like the
looks of things on board this ship, they may not be so bad
after all, for it is possible that the `Ancient Mariner' was but
voicing the desires of his wicked old heart rather than speaking
of real facts.
 
"Mutiny on the high sea may have been common a hundred
years ago, but in this good year 1888 it is the least likely
of happenings.
 
"But there goes the captain to his cabin now.  If I am going
to warn him I might as well get the beastly job over for I
have little stomach to talk with the brute at all."
 
So saying he strolled carelessly in the direction of the
companionway through which the captain had passed, and a
moment later was knocking at his door.
 
"Come in," growled the deep tones of that surly officer.
 
And when Clayton had entered, and closed the door behind him:
 
"Well?"
 
"I have come to report the gist of a conversation I heard
to-day, because I feel that, while there may be nothing to it,
it is as well that you be forearmed.  In short, the men
contemplate mutiny and murder."
 
"It's a lie!" roared the captain.  "And if you have been
interfering again with the discipline of this ship, or meddling
in affairs that don't concern you you can take the consequences,
and be damned.  I don't care whether you are an English lord
or not.  I'm captain of this here ship, and from now on you
keep your meddling nose out of my business."
 
The captain had worked himself up to such a frenzy of
rage that he was fairly purple of face, and he shrieked the
last words at the top of his voice, emphasizing his remarks by
a loud thumping of the table with one huge fist, and shaking
the other in Clayton's face.
 
Greystoke never turned a hair, but stood eying the excited
man with level gaze.
 
"Captain Billings," he drawled finally, "if you will pardon
my candor, I might remark that you are something of an ass."
 
Whereupon he turned and left the captain with the same
indifferent ease that was habitual with him, and which was
more surely calculated to raise the ire of a man of Billings'
class than a torrent of invective.
 
So, whereas the captain might easily have been brought to
regret his hasty speech had Clayton attempted to conciliate
him, his temper was now irrevocably set in the mold in which
Clayton had left it, and the last chance of their working
together for their common good was gone.
 
"Well, Alice," said Clayton, as he rejoined his wife, "I might
have saved my breath.  The fellow proved most ungrateful.
Fairly jumped at me like a mad dog.
 
"He and his blasted old ship may hang, for aught I care;
and until we are safely off the thing I shall spend my energies
in looking after our own welfare.  And I rather fancy the first
step to that end should be to go to our cabin and look over
my revolvers.  I am sorry now that we packed the larger guns
and the ammunition with the stuff below."
 
They found their quarters in a bad state of disorder.  Clothing
from their open boxes and bags strewed the little apartment,
and even their beds had been torn to pieces.
 
"Evidently someone was more anxious about our belongings
than we," said Clayton.  "Let's have a look around, Alice,
and see what's missing."
 
A thorough search revealed the fact that nothing had been
taken but Clayton's two revolvers and the small supply of
ammunition he had saved out for them.
 
"Those are the very things I most wish they had left us,"
said Clayton, "and the fact that they wished for them and
them alone is most sinister."
 
"What are we to do, John?" asked his wife.  "Perhaps you
were right in that our best chance lies in maintaining a
neutral position.
 
"If the officers are able to prevent a mutiny, we have nothing
to fear, while if the mutineers are victorious our one slim
hope lies in not having attempted to thwart or antagonize them."
 
"Right you are, Alice.  We'll keep in the middle of the road."
 
As they started to straighten up their cabin, Clayton and
his wife simultaneously noticed the corner of a piece of paper
protruding from beneath the door of their quarters.  As Clayton
stooped to reach for it he was amazed to see it move
further into the room, and then he realized that it was being
pushed inward by someone from without.
 
Quickly and silently he stepped toward the door, but, as
he reached for the knob to throw it open, his wife's hand fell
upon his wrist.
 
"No, John," she whispered.  "They do not wish to be seen,
and so we cannot afford to see them.  Do not forget that we
are keeping to the middle of the road."
 
Clayton smiled and dropped his hand to his side.  Thus
they stood watching the little bit of white paper until it
finally remained at rest upon the floor just inside the door.
 
Then Clayton stooped and picked it up.  It was a bit of
grimy, white paper roughly folded into a ragged square.
Opening it they found a crude message printed almost
illegibly, and with many evidences of an unaccustomed task.
 
Translated, it was a warning to the Claytons to refrain
from reporting the loss of the revolvers, or from repeating
what the old sailor had told them--to refrain on pain of death.
 
"I rather imagine we'll be good," said Clayton with a rueful
smile.  "About all we can do is to sit tight and wait for
whatever may come."
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
Nor did they have long to wait, for the next morning as
Clayton was emerging on deck for his accustomed walk before
breakfast, a shot rang out, and then another, and another.
 
The sight which met his eyes confirmed his worst fears.
Facing the little knot of officers was the entire motley crew
of the Fuwalda, and at their head stood Black Michael.
 
At the first volley from the officers the men ran for shelter,
and from points of vantage behind masts, wheel-house and
cabin they returned the fire of the five men who represented
the hated authority of the ship.
 
Two of their number had gone down before the captain's
revolver.  They lay where they had fallen between the
combatants.  But then the first mate lunged forward upon his
face, and at a cry of command from Black Michael the mutineers
charged the remaining four.  The crew had been able to muster
but six firearms, so most of them were armed with boat
hooks, axes, hatchets and crowbars.
 
The captain had emptied his revolver and was reloading as
the charge was made.  The second mate's gun had jammed,
and so there were but two weapons opposed to the mutineers
as they bore down upon the officers, who now started to give
back before the infuriated rush of their men.
 
Both sides were cursing and swearing in a frightful manner,
which, together with the reports of the firearms and the
screams and groans of the wounded, turned the deck of the
Fuwalda to the likeness of a madhouse.
 
Before the officers had taken a dozen backward steps the
men were upon them.  An ax in the hands of a burly Negro
cleft the captain from forehead to chin, and an instant later
the others were down: dead or wounded from dozens of
blows and bullet wounds.
 
Short and grisly had been the work of the mutineers of the
Fuwalda, and through it all John Clayton had stood leaning
carelessly beside the companionway puffing meditatively upon
his pipe as though he had been but watching an indifferent
cricket match.
 
As the last officer went down he thought it was time that
he returned to his wife lest some members of the crew find
her alone below.
 
Though outwardly calm and indifferent, Clayton was inwardly
apprehensive and wrought up, for he feared for his wife's
safety at the hands of these ignorant, half-brutes into
whose hands fate had so remorselessly thrown them.
 
As he turned to descend the ladder he was surprised to see
his wife standing on the steps almost at his side.
 
"How long have you been here, Alice?"
 
"Since the beginning," she replied.  "How awful, John.  Oh,
how awful!  What can we hope for at the hands of such as those?"
 
"Breakfast, I hope," he answered, smiling bravely in an
attempt to allay her fears.
 
"At least," he added, "I'm going to ask them.  Come with
me, Alice.  We must not let them think we expect any but
courteous treatment."
 
The men had by this time surrounded the dead and wounded
officers, and without either partiality or compassion
proceeded to throw both living and dead over the sides of
the vessel.  With equal heartlessness they disposed of their
own dead and dying.
 
Presently one of the crew spied the approaching Claytons,
and with a cry of:  "Here's two more for the fishes," rushed
toward them with uplifted ax.
 
But Black Michael was even quicker, so that the fellow
went down with a bullet in his back before he had taken a
half dozen steps.
 
With a loud roar, Black Michael attracted the attention of
the others, and, pointing to Lord and Lady Greystoke, cried:
 
"These here are my friends, and they are to be left alone.
D'ye understand?
 
"I'm captain of this ship now, an' what I says goes," he
added, turning to Clayton.  "Just keep to yourselves, and
nobody'll harm ye," and he looked threateningly on his fellows.
 
The Claytons heeded Black Michael's instructions so well
that they saw but little of the crew and knew nothing of the
plans the men were making.
 
Occasionally they heard faint echoes of brawls and quarreling
among the mutineers, and on two occasions the vicious
bark of firearms rang out on the still air.  But Black Michael
was a fit leader for this band of cutthroats, and, withal held
them in fair subjection to his rule.
 
On the fifth day following the murder of the ship's officers,
land was sighted by the lookout.  Whether island or mainland,
Black Michael did not know, but he announced to Clayton
that if investigation showed that the place was habitable he
and Lady Greystoke were to be put ashore with their belongings.
 
"You'll be all right there for a few months," he explained,
"and by that time we'll have been able to make an inhabited
coast somewhere and scatter a bit.  Then I'll see that yer
gover'ment's notified where you be an' they'll soon send a man-
o'war to fetch ye off.
 
"It would be a hard matter to land you in civilization without
a lot o' questions being asked, an' none o' us here has any
very convincin' answers up our sleeves."
 
Clayton remonstrated against the inhumanity of landing
them upon an unknown shore to be left to the mercies of
savage beasts, and, possibly, still more savage men.
 
But his words were of no avail, and only tended to anger
Black Michael, so he was forced to desist and make the best
he could of a bad situation.
 
About three o'clock in the afternoon they came about off a
beautiful wooded shore opposite the mouth of what appeared
to be a land-locked harbor.
 
Black Michael sent a small boat filled with men to sound
the entrance in an effort to determine if the Fuwalda
could be safely worked through the entrance.
 
In about an hour they returned and reported deep water
through the passage as well as far into the little basin.
 
Before dark the barkentine lay peacefully at anchor upon
the bosom of the still, mirror-like surface of the harbor.
 
The surrounding shores were beautiful with semitropical
verdure, while in the distance the country rose from the
ocean in hill and tableland, almost uniformly clothed by
primeval forest.
 
No signs of habitation were visible, but that the land might
easily support human life was evidenced by the abundant bird
and animal life of which the watchers on the Fuwalda's deck
caught occasional glimpses, as well as by the shimmer of a
little river which emptied into the harbor, insuring fresh
water in plenitude.
 
As darkness settled upon the earth, Clayton and Lady
Alice still stood by the ship's rail in silent contemplation of
their future abode.  From the dark shadows of the mighty forest
came the wild calls of savage beasts--the deep roar of the
lion, and, occasionally, the shrill scream of a panther.
 
The woman shrank closer to the man in terror-stricken
anticipation of the horrors lying in wait for them in the awful
blackness of the nights to come, when they should be alone
upon that wild and lonely shore.
 
Later in the evening Black Michael joined them long
enough to instruct them to make their preparations for landing
on the morrow.  They tried to persuade him to take them
to some more hospitable coast near enough to civilization so
that they might hope to fall into friendly hands.  But no pleas,
or threats, or promises of reward could move him.
 
"I am the only man aboard who would not rather see ye
both safely dead, and, while I know that's the sensible way to
make sure of our own necks, yet Black Michael's not the
man to forget a favor.  Ye saved my life once, and in return
I'm goin' to spare yours, but that's all I can do.
 
"The men won't stand for any more, and if we don't get ye
landed pretty quick they may even change their minds about
giving ye that much show.  I'll put all yer stuff ashore with ye
as well as cookin' utensils an' some old sails for tents, an'
enough grub to last ye until ye can find fruit and game.
 
"With yer guns for protection, ye ought to be able to live
here easy enough until help comes.  When I get safely hid
away I'll see to it that the British gover'ment learns about
where ye be; for the life of me I couldn't tell 'em exactly
where, for I don't know myself.  But they'll find ye all right."
 
After he had left them they went silently below, each
wrapped in gloomy forebodings.
 
Clayton did not believe that Black Michael had the slightest
intention of notifying the British government of their
whereabouts, nor was he any too sure but that some treachery
was contemplated for the following day when they should
be on shore with the sailors who would have to accompany
them with their belongings.
 
Once out of Black Michael's sight any of the men might strike
them down, and still leave Black Michael's conscience clear.
 
And even should they escape that fate was it not but to be
faced with far graver dangers?  Alone, he might hope to survive
for years; for he was a strong, athletic man.
 
But what of Alice, and that other little life so soon to be
launched amidst the hardships and grave dangers of a primeval world?
 
The man shuddered as he meditated upon the awful gravity,
the fearful helplessness, of their situation.  But it was a
merciful Providence which prevented him from foreseeing
the hideous reality which awaited them in the grim depths of
that gloomy wood.
 
Early next morning their numerous chests and boxes were
hoisted on deck and lowered to waiting small boats for
transportation to shore.
 
There was a great quantity and variety of stuff, as the
Claytons had expected a possible five to eight years' residence
in their new home.  Thus, in addition to the many necessities
they had brought, there were also many luxuries.
 
Black Michael was determined that nothing belonging to
the Claytons should be left on board.  Whether out of
compassion for them, or in furtherance of his own self-interests,
it would be difficult to say.
 
There was no question but that the presence of property of a
missing British official upon a suspicious vessel would have been
a difficult thing to explain in any civilized port in the world.
 
So zealous was he in his efforts to carry out his intentions
that he insisted upon the return of Clayton's revolvers to him
by the sailors in whose possession they were.
 
Into the small boats were also loaded salt meats and biscuit,
with a small supply of potatoes and beans, matches, and
cooking vessels, a chest of tools, and the old sails which
Black Michael had promised them.
 
As though himself fearing the very thing which Clayton
had suspected, Black Michael accompanied them to shore,
and was the last to leave them when the small boats, having
filled the ship's casks with fresh water, were pushed out
toward the waiting Fuwalda.
 
As the boats moved slowly over the smooth waters of the
bay, Clayton and his wife stood silently watching their
departure--in the breasts of both a feeling of impending
disaster and utter hopelessness.
 
And behind them, over the edge of a low ridge, other eyes
watched--close set, wicked eyes, gleaming beneath shaggy brows.
 
As the Fuwalda passed through the narrow entrance to the
harbor and out of sight behind a projecting point, Lady Alice
threw her arms about Clayton's neck and burst into uncontrolled sobs.
 
Bravely had she faced the dangers of the mutiny; with heroic
fortitude she had looked into the terrible future; but now
that the horror of absolute solitude was upon them, her
overwrought nerves gave way, and the reaction came.
 
He did not attempt to check her tears.  It were better that
nature have her way in relieving these long-pent emotions, and
it was many minutes before the girl--little more than a child
she was--could again gain mastery of herself.
 
"Oh, John," she cried at last, "the horror of it.  What are we
to do?  What are we to do?"
 
"There is but one thing to do, Alice," and he spoke as quietly
as though they were sitting in their snug living room at home,
"and that is work.  Work must be our salvation.  We must not
give ourselves time to think, for in that direction lies madness.
 
"We must work and wait.  I am sure that relief will come,
and come quickly, when once it is apparent that the Fuwalda
has been lost, even though Black Michael does not keep his
word to us."
 
"But John, if it were only you and I," she sobbed, "we
could endure it I know; but--"
 
"Yes, dear," he answered, gently, "I have been thinking of
that, also; but we must face it, as we must face whatever
comes, bravely and with the utmost confidence in our ability
to cope with circumstances whatever they may be.
 
"Hundreds of thousands of years ago our ancestors of the
dim and distant past faced the same problems which we must
face, possibly in these same primeval forests.  That we are
here today evidences their victory.
 
"What they did may we not do?  And even better, for are
we not armed with ages of superior knowledge, and have we
not the means of protection, defense, and sustenance which
science has given us, but of which they were totally ignorant?
What they accomplished, Alice, with instruments and weapons
of stone and bone, surely that may we accomplish also."
 
"Ah, John, I wish that I might be a man with a man's
philosophy, but I am but a woman, seeing with my heart rather
than my head, and all that I can see is too horrible, too
unthinkable to put into words.
 
"I only hope you are right, John.  I will do my best to be a
brave primeval woman, a fit mate for the primeval man."
 
Clayton's first thought was to arrange a sleeping shelter for
the night; something which might serve to protect them from
prowling beasts of prey.
 
He opened the box containing his rifles and ammunition,
that they might both be armed against possible attack while
at work, and then together they sought a location for their
first night's sleeping place.
 
A hundred yards from the beach was a little level spot,
fairly free of trees; here they decided eventually to build a
permanent house, but for the time being they both thought it
best to construct a little platform in the trees out of reach of
the larger of the savage beasts in whose realm they were.
 
To this end Clayton selected four trees which formed a
rectangle about eight feet square, and cutting long branches
from other trees he constructed a framework around them,
about ten feet from the ground, fastening the ends of the
branches securely to the trees by means of rope, a quantity
of which Black Michael had furnished him from the hold of
the Fuwalda.
 
Across this framework Clayton placed other smaller
branches quite close together.  This platform he paved with
the huge fronds of elephant's ear which grew in profusion
about them, and over the fronds he laid a great sail folded
into several thicknesses.
 
Seven feet higher he constructed a similar, though lighter
platform to serve as roof, and from the sides of this he
suspended the balance of his sailcloth for walls.
 
When completed he had a rather snug little nest, to which
he carried their blankets and some of the lighter luggage.
 
It was now late in the afternoon, and the balance of the
daylight hours were devoted to the building of a rude ladder
by means of which Lady Alice could mount to her new home.
 
All during the day the forest about them had been filled with
excited birds of brilliant plumage, and dancing, chattering
monkeys, who watched these new arrivals and their wonderful
nest building operations with every mark of keenest interest
and fascination.
 
Notwithstanding that both Clayton and his wife kept a
sharp lookout they saw nothing of larger animals, though on
two occasions they had seen their little simian neighbors
come screaming and chattering from the near-by ridge, casting
frightened glances back over their little shoulders, and
evincing as plainly as though by speech that they were fleeing
some terrible thing which lay concealed there.
 
Just before dusk Clayton finished his ladder, and, filling a
great basin with water from the near-by stream, the two
mounted to the comparative safety of their aerial chamber.
 
As it was quite warm, Clayton had left the side curtains
thrown back over the roof, and as they sat, like Turks, upon
their blankets, Lady Alice, straining her eyes into the darkening
shadows of the wood, suddenly reached out and grasped
Clayton's arms.
 
"John," she whispered, "look!  What is it, a man?"
 
As Clayton turned his eyes in the direction she indicated,
he saw silhouetted dimly against the shadows beyond, a great
figure standing upright upon the ridge.
 
For a moment it stood as though listening and then turned
slowly, and melted into the shadows of the jungle.
 
"What is it, John?"
 
"I do not know, Alice," he answered gravely, "it is too
dark to see so far, and it may have been but a shadow cast by
the rising moon."
 
"No, John, if it was not a man it was some huge and grotesque
mockery of man.  Oh, I am afraid."
 
He gathered her in his arms, whispering words of courage
and love into her ears.
 
Soon after, he lowered the curtain walls, tying them securely
to the trees so that, except for a little opening toward
the beach, they were entirely enclosed.
 
As it was now pitch dark within their tiny aerie they lay
down upon their blankets to try to gain, through sleep, a
brief respite of forgetfulness.
 
Clayton lay facing the opening at the front, a rifle and a
brace of revolvers at his hand.
 
Scarcely had they closed their eyes than the terrifying cry
of a panther rang out from the jungle behind them.  Closer
and closer it came until they could hear the great beast
directly beneath them.  For an hour or more they heard it
sniffing and clawing at the trees which supported their platform,
but at last it roamed away across the beach, where Clayton
could see it clearly in the brilliant moonlight--a great, handsome
beast, the largest he had ever seen.
 
During the long hours of darkness they caught but fitful
snatches of sleep, for the night noises of a great jungle
teeming with myriad animal life kept their overwrought nerves
on edge, so that a hundred times they were startled to
wakefulness by piercing screams, or the stealthy moving of
great bodies beneath them.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
Morning found them but little, if at all refreshed, though
it was with a feeling of intense relief that they saw the
day dawn.
 
As soon as they had made their meager breakfast of salt
pork, coffee and biscuit, Clayton commenced work upon their
house, for he realized that they could hope for no safety and
no peace of mind at night until four strong walls effectually
barred the jungle life from them.
 
The task was an arduous one and required the better part of
a month, though he built but one small room.  He constructed
his cabin of small logs about six inches in diameter,
stopping the chinks with clay which he found at the depth of
a few feet beneath the surface soil.
 
At one end he built a fireplace of small stones from the
beach.  These also he set in clay and when the house had been
entirely completed he applied a coating of the clay to the
entire outside surface to the thickness of four inches.
 
In the window opening he set small branches about an inch in
diameter both vertically and horizontally, and so woven that they
formed a substantial grating that could withstand the strength
of a powerful animal.  Thus they obtained air and proper
ventilation without fear of lessening the safety of their cabin.
 
The A-shaped roof was thatched with small branches laid
close together and over these long jungle grass and palm
fronds, with a final coating of clay.
 
The door he built of pieces of the packing-boxes which
had held their belongings, nailing one piece upon another, the
grain of contiguous layers running transversely, until he had
a solid body some three inches thick and of such great
strength that they were both moved to laughter as they gazed
upon it.
 
Here the greatest difficulty confronted Clayton, for he had
no means whereby to hang his massive door now that he had
built it.  After two days' work, however, he succeeded in
fashioning two massive hardwood hinges, and with these he
hung the door so that it opened and closed easily.
 
The stuccoing and other final touches were added after
they moved into the house, which they had done as soon as
the roof was on, piling their boxes before the door at night
and thus having a comparatively safe and comfortable habitation.
 
The building of a bed, chairs, table, and shelves was a
relatively easy matter, so that by the end of the second month
they were well settled, and, but for the constant dread of
attack by wild beasts and the ever growing loneliness, they
were not uncomfortable or unhappy.
 
At night great beasts snarled and roared about their tiny
cabin, but, so accustomed may one become to oft repeated
noises, that soon they paid little attention to them, sleeping
soundly the whole night through.
 
Thrice had they caught fleeting glimpses of great man-like
figures like that of the first night, but never at sufficiently
close range to know positively whether the half-seen forms
were those of man or brute.
 
The brilliant birds and the little monkeys had become accustomed
to their new acquaintances, and as they had evidently never
seen human beings before they presently, after their first
fright had worn off, approached closer and closer, impelled
by that strange curiosity which dominates the wild creatures
of the forest and the jungle and the plain, so that within
the first month several of the birds had gone so far as even
to accept morsels of food from the friendly hands of the Claytons.
 
One afternoon, while Clayton was working upon an addition
to their cabin, for he contemplated building several more
rooms, a number of their grotesque little friends came shrieking
and scolding through the trees from the direction of the
ridge.  Ever as they fled they cast fearful glances back of
them, and finally they stopped near Clayton jabbering excitedly
to him as though to warn him of approaching danger.
 
At last he saw it, the thing the little monkeys so feared--
the man-brute of which the Claytons had caught occasional
fleeting glimpses.
 
It was approaching through the jungle in a semi-erect position,
now and then placing the backs of its closed fists upon the
ground--a great anthropoid ape, and, as it advanced, it emitted
deep guttural growls and an occasional low barking sound.
 
Clayton was at some distance from the cabin, having come
to fell a particularly perfect tree for his building operations.
Grown careless from months of continued safety, during
which time he had seen no dangerous animals during the daylight
hours, he had left his rifles and revolvers all within the
little cabin, and now that he saw the great ape crashing
through the underbrush directly toward him, and from a
direction which practically cut him off from escape, he
felt a vague little shiver play up and down his spine.
 
He knew that, armed only with an ax, his chances with this
ferocious monster were small indeed--and Alice; O God, he
thought, what will become of Alice?
 
There was yet a slight chance of reaching the cabin.  He
turned and ran toward it, shouting an alarm to his wife to run
in and close the great door in case the ape cut off his retreat.
 
Lady Greystoke had been sitting a little way from the
cabin, and when she heard his cry she looked up to see the
ape springing with almost incredible swiftness, for so large
and awkward an animal, in an effort to head off Clayton.
 
With a low cry she sprang toward the cabin, and, as she
entered, gave a backward glance which filled her soul with
terror, for the brute had intercepted her husband, who now
stood at bay grasping his ax with both hands ready to swing
it upon the infuriated animal when he should make his final
charge.
 
"Close and bolt the door, Alice," cried Clayton.  "I can
finish this fellow with my ax."
 
But he knew he was facing a horrible death, and so did she.
 
The ape was a great bull, weighing probably three hundred
pounds.  His nasty, close-set eyes gleamed hatred from beneath
his shaggy brows, while his great canine fangs were bared
in a horrid snarl as he paused a moment before his prey.
 
Over the brute's shoulder Clayton could see the doorway
of his cabin, not twenty paces distant, and a great wave of
horror and fear swept over him as he saw his young wife
emerge, armed with one of his rifles.
 
She had always been afraid of firearms, and would never
touch them, but now she rushed toward the ape with the
fearlessness of a lioness protecting its young.
 
"Back, Alice," shouted Clayton, "for God's sake, go back."
 
But she would not heed, and just then the ape charged, so
that Clayton could say no more.
 
The man swung his ax with all his mighty strength, but the
powerful brute seized it in those terrible hands, and tearing it
from Clayton's grasp hurled it far to one side.
 
With an ugly snarl he closed upon his defenseless victim,
but ere his fangs had reached the throat they thirsted for,
there was a sharp report and a bullet entered the ape's back
between his shoulders.
 
Throwing Clayton to the ground the beast turned upon his
new enemy.  There before him stood the terrified girl vainly
trying to fire another bullet into the animal's body; but she
did not understand the mechanism of the firearm, and the
hammer fell futilely upon an empty cartridge.
 
Almost simultaneously Clayton regained his feet, and without
thought of the utter hopelessness of it, he rushed forward
to drag the ape from his wife's prostrate form.
 
With little or no effort he succeeded, and the great bulk
rolled inertly upon the turf before him--the ape was dead.
The bullet had done its work.
 
A hasty examination of his wife revealed no marks upon
her, and Clayton decided that the huge brute had died the
instant he had sprung toward Alice.
 
Gently he lifted his wife's still unconscious form, and bore
her to the little cabin, but it was fully two hours before she
regained consciousness.
 
Her first words filled Clayton with vague apprehension.
For some time after regaining her senses, Alice gazed
wonderingly about the interior of the little cabin, and
then, with a satisfied sigh, said:
 
"O, John, it is so good to be really home!  I have had an
awful dream, dear.  I thought we were no longer in London,
but in some horrible place where great beasts attacked us."
 
"There, there, Alice," he said, stroking her forehead, "try
to sleep again, and do not worry your head about bad dreams."
 
That night a little son was born in the tiny cabin beside the
primeval forest, while a leopard screamed before the door, and
the deep notes of a lion's roar sounded from beyond the ridge.
 
Lady Greystoke never recovered from the shock of the
great ape's attack, and, though she lived for a year after her
baby was born, she was never again outside the cabin, nor
did she ever fully realize that she was not in England.
 
Sometimes she would question Clayton as to the strange
noises of the nights; the absence of servants and friends, and
the strange rudeness of the furnishings within her room, but,
though he made no effort to deceive her, never could she
grasp the meaning of it all.
 
In other ways she was quite rational, and the joy and happiness
she took in the possession of her little son and the constant
attentions of her husband made that year a very happy
one for her, the happiest of her young life.
 
That it would have been beset by worries and apprehension
had she been in full command of her mental faculties Clayton
well knew; so that while he suffered terribly to see her so,
there were times when he was almost glad, for her sake, that
she could not understand.
 
Long since had he given up any hope of rescue, except
through accident.  With unremitting zeal he had worked to
beautify the interior of the cabin.
 
Skins of lion and panther covered the floor.  Cupboards and
bookcases lined the walls.  Odd vases made by his own hand
from the clay of the region held beautiful tropical flowers.
Curtains of grass and bamboo covered the windows, and,
most arduous task of all, with his meager assortment of tools
he had fashioned lumber to neatly seal the walls and ceiling
and lay a smooth floor within the cabin.
 
That he had been able to turn his hands at all to such
unaccustomed labor was a source of mild wonder to him.
But he loved the work because it was for her and the tiny life
that had come to cheer them, though adding a hundredfold
to his responsibilities and to the terribleness of their situation.
 
During the year that followed, Clayton was several times
attacked by the great apes which now seemed to continually
infest the vicinity of the cabin; but as he never again
ventured outside without both rifle and revolvers he had
little fear of the huge beasts.
 
He had strengthened the window protections and fitted a
unique wooden lock to the cabin door, so that when he
hunted for game and fruits, as it was constantly necessary for
him to do to insure sustenance, he had no fear that any animal
could break into the little home.
 
At first he shot much of the game from the cabin windows,
but toward the end the animals learned to fear the strange
lair from whence issued the terrifying thunder of his rifle.
 
In his leisure Clayton read, often aloud to his wife, from
the store of books he had brought for their new home.
Among these were many for little children--picture books,
primers, readers--for they had known that their little child
would be old enough for such before they might hope to return
to England.
 
At other times Clayton wrote in his diary, which he had
always been accustomed to keep in French, and in which he
recorded the details of their strange life.  This book he kept
locked in a little metal box.
 
A year from the day her little son was born Lady Alice
passed quietly away in the night.  So peaceful was her end
that it was hours before Clayton could awake to a realization
that his wife was dead.
 
The horror of the situation came to him very slowly, and it
is doubtful that he ever fully realized the enormity of his
sorrow and the fearful responsibility that had devolved upon
him with the care of that wee thing, his son, still a nursing babe.
 
The last entry in his diary was made the morning following
her death, and there he recites the sad details in a matter-of-
fact way that adds to the pathos of it; for it breathes a tired
apathy born of long sorrow and hopelessness, which even this
cruel blow could scarcely awake to further suffering:
 
 
My little son is crying for nourishment--O Alice, Alice,
what shall I do?
 
 
And as John Clayton wrote the last words his hand was
destined ever to pen, he dropped his head wearily upon his
outstretched arms where they rested upon the table he had
built for her who lay still and cold in the bed beside him.
 
For a long time no sound broke the deathlike stillness of
the jungle midday save the piteous wailing of the tiny man-child.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
In the forest of the table-land a mile back from the ocean
old Kerchak the Ape was on a rampage of rage among his people.
 
The younger and lighter members of his tribe scampered to
the higher branches of the great trees to escape his wrath;
risking their lives upon branches that scarce supported their
weight rather than face old Kerchak in one of his fits of
uncontrolled anger.
 
The other males scattered in all directions, but not before
the infuriated brute had felt the vertebra of one snap between
his great, foaming jaws.
 
A luckless young female slipped from an insecure hold
upon a high branch and came crashing to the ground almost
at Kerchak's feet.
 
With a wild scream he was upon her, tearing a great piece
from her side with his mighty teeth, and striking her viciously
upon her head and shoulders with a broken tree limb until
her skull was crushed to a jelly.
 
And then he spied Kala, who, returning from a search for
food with her young babe, was ignorant of the state of the
mighty male's temper until suddenly the shrill warnings of
her fellows caused her to scamper madly for safety.
 
But Kerchak was close upon her, so close that he had almost
grasped her ankle had she not made a furious leap far into
space from one tree to another--a perilous chance which
apes seldom if ever take, unless so closely pursued by danger
that there is no alternative.
 
She made the leap successfully, but as she grasped the limb
of the further tree the sudden jar loosened the hold of the
tiny babe where it clung frantically to her neck, and she saw
the little thing hurled, turning and twisting, to the ground
thirty feet below.
 
With a low cry of dismay Kala rushed headlong to its side,
thoughtless now of the danger from Kerchak; but when she
gathered the wee, mangled form to her bosom life had left it.
 
With low moans, she sat cuddling the body to her; nor did
Kerchak attempt to molest her.  With the death of the babe his
fit of demoniacal rage passed as suddenly as it had seized him.
 
Kerchak was a huge king ape, weighing perhaps three hundred
and fifty pounds.  His forehead was extremely low and receding,
his eyes bloodshot, small and close set to his coarse, flat
nose; his ears large and thin, but smaller than most of his kind.
 
His awful temper and his mighty strength made him supreme
among the little tribe into which he had been born some
twenty years before.
 
Now that he was in his prime, there was no simian in all the
mighty forest through which he roved that dared contest his
right to rule, nor did the other and larger animals molest him.
 
Old Tantor, the elephant, alone of all the wild savage life,
feared him not--and he alone did Kerchak fear.  When Tantor
trumpeted, the great ape scurried with his fellows high
among the trees of the second terrace.
 
The tribe of anthropoids over which Kerchak ruled with an
iron hand and bared fangs, numbered some six or eight families,
each family consisting of an adult male with his females and
their young, numbering in all some sixty or seventy apes.
 
Kala was the youngest mate of a male called Tublat,
meaning broken nose, and the child she had seen dashed to
death was her first; for she was but nine or ten years old.
 
Notwithstanding her youth, she was large and powerful--a
splendid, clean-limbed animal, with a round, high forehead,
which denoted more intelligence than most of her kind
possessed.  So, also, she had a great capacity for mother love
and mother sorrow.
 
But she was still an ape, a huge, fierce, terrible beast of a
species closely allied to the gorilla, yet more intelligent;
which, with the strength of their cousin, made her kind the
most fearsome of those awe-inspiring progenitors of man.
 
When the tribe saw that Kerchak's rage had ceased they
came slowly down from their arboreal retreats and pursued
again the various occupations which he had interrupted.
 
The young played and frolicked about among the trees and
bushes.  Some of the adults lay prone upon the soft mat of
dead and decaying vegetation which covered the ground,
while others turned over pieces of fallen branches and clods
of earth in search of the small bugs and reptiles which
formed a part of their food.
 
Others, again, searched the surrounding trees for fruit,
nuts, small birds, and eggs.
 
They had passed an hour or so thus when Kerchak called
them together, and, with a word of command to them to
follow him, set off toward the sea.
 
They traveled for the most part upon the ground, where it
was open, following the path of the great elephants whose
comings and goings break the only roads through those
tangled mazes of bush, vine, creeper, and tree.  When they
walked it was with a rolling, awkward motion, placing the
knuckles of their closed hands upon the ground and swinging
their ungainly bodies forward.
 
But when the way was through the lower trees they moved
more swiftly, swinging from branch to branch with the agility
of their smaller cousins, the monkeys.  And all the way Kala
carried her little dead baby hugged closely to her breast.
 
It was shortly after noon when they reached a ridge
overlooking the beach where below them lay the tiny cottage
which was Kerchak's goal.
 
He had seen many of his kind go to their deaths before the
loud noise made by the little black stick in the hands of the
strange white ape who lived in that wonderful lair, and Kerchak
had made up his brute mind to own that death-dealing
contrivance, and to explore the interior of the mysterious den.
 
He wanted, very, very much, to feel his teeth sink into the
neck of the queer animal that he had learned to hate and
fear, and because of this, he came often with his tribe to
reconnoiter, waiting for a time when the white ape should be
off his guard.
 
Of late they had quit attacking, or even showing themselves;
for every time they had done so in the past the little
stick had roared out its terrible message of death to some
member of the tribe.
 
Today there was no sign of the man about, and from
where they watched they could see that the cabin door was
open.  Slowly, cautiously, and noiselessly they crept through
the jungle toward the little cabin.
 
There were no growls, no fierce screams of rage--the little
black stick had taught them to come quietly lest they awaken it.
 
On, on they came until Kerchak himself slunk stealthily to the
very door and peered within.  Behind him were two males, and
then Kala, closely straining the little dead form to her breast.
 
Inside the den they saw the strange white ape lying half
across a table, his head buried in his arms; and on the bed
lay a figure covered by a sailcloth, while from a tiny rustic
cradle came the plaintive wailing of a babe.
 
Noiselessly Kerchak entered, crouching for the charge; and
then John Clayton rose with a sudden start and faced them.
 
The sight that met his eyes must have frozen him with horror,
for there, within the door, stood three great bull apes,
while behind them crowded many more; how many he never
knew, for his revolvers were hanging on the far wall beside
his rifle, and Kerchak was charging.
 
When the king ape released the limp form which had been
John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, he turned his attention toward
the little cradle; but Kala was there before him, and
when he would have grasped the child she snatched it herself,
and before he could intercept her she had bolted through the
door and taken refuge in a high tree.
 
As she took up the little live baby of Alice Clayton she
dropped the dead body of her own into the empty cradle; for
the wail of the living had answered the call of universal
motherhood within her wild breast which the dead could not still.
 
High up among the branches of a mighty tree she hugged
the shrieking infant to her bosom, and soon the instinct that
was as dominant in this fierce female as it had been in the
breast of his tender and beautiful mother--the instinct of
mother love--reached out to the tiny man-child's half-formed
understanding, and he became quiet.
 
Then hunger closed the gap between them, and the son of
an English lord and an English lady nursed at the breast of
Kala, the great ape.
 
In the meantime the beasts within the cabin were warily
examining the contents of this strange lair.
 
Once satisfied that Clayton was dead, Kerchak turned his
attention to the thing which lay upon the bed, covered by a
piece of sailcloth.
 
Gingerly he lifted one corner of the shroud, but when he
saw the body of the woman beneath he tore the cloth roughly
from her form and seized the still, white throat in his huge,
hairy hands.
 
A moment he let his fingers sink deep into the cold flesh,
and then, realizing that she was already dead, he turned from
her, to examine the contents of the room; nor did he again
molest the body of either Lady Alice or Sir John.
 
The rifle hanging upon the wall caught his first attention; it
was for this strange, death-dealing thunder-stick that he had
yearned for months; but now that it was within his grasp he
scarcely had the temerity to seize it.
 
Cautiously he approached the thing, ready to flee
precipitately should it speak in its deep roaring tones,
as he had heard it speak before, the last words to those
of his kind who, through ignorance or rashness, had attacked
the wonderful white ape that had borne it.
 
Deep in the beast's intelligence was something which assured
him that the thunder-stick was only dangerous when in the
hands of one who could manipulate it, but yet it was several
minutes ere he could bring himself to touch it.
 
Instead, he walked back and forth along the floor before it,
turning his head so that never once did his eyes leave the
object of his desire.
 
Using his long arms as a man uses crutches, and rolling his
huge carcass from side to side with each stride, the great king
ape paced to and fro, uttering deep growls, occasionally
punctuated with the ear-piercing scream, than which there is
no more terrifying noise in all the jungle.
 
Presently he halted before the rifle.  Slowly he raised a
huge hand until it almost touched the shining barrel, only to
withdraw it once more and continue his hurried pacing.
 
It was as though the great brute by this show of fearlessness,
and through the medium of his wild voice, was endeavoring
to bolster up his courage to the point which would permit
him to take the rifle in his hand.
 
Again he stopped, and this time succeeded in forcing his
reluctant hand to the cold steel, only to snatch it away almost
immediately and resume his restless beat.
 
Time after time this strange ceremony was repeated, but on each
occasion with increased confidence, until, finally, the rifle
was torn from its hook and lay in the grasp of the great brute.
 
Finding that it harmed him not, Kerchak began to examine
it closely.  He felt of it from end to end, peered down the
black depths of the muzzle, fingered the sights, the breech,
the stock, and finally the trigger.
 
During all these operations the apes who had entered sat
huddled near the door watching their chief, while those outside
strained and crowded to catch a glimpse of what transpired within.
 
Suddenly Kerchak's finger closed upon the trigger.  There was
a deafening roar in the little room and the apes at and beyond
the door fell over one another in their wild anxiety to escape.
 
Kerchak was equally frightened, so frightened, in fact, that he
quite forgot to throw aside the author of that fearful noise,
but bolted for the door with it tightly clutched in one hand.
 
As he passed through the opening, the front sight of the
rifle caught upon the edge of the inswung door with sufficient
force to close it tightly after the fleeing ape.
 
When Kerchak came to a halt a short distance from the cabin
and discovered that he still held the rifle, he dropped it
as he might have dropped a red hot iron, nor did he again
attempt to recover it--the noise was too much for his brute
nerves; but he was now quite convinced that the terrible stick
was quite harmless by itself if left alone.
 
It was an hour before the apes could again bring themselves
to approach the cabin to continue their investigations,
and when they finally did so, they found to their chagrin that
the door was closed and so securely fastened that they could
not force it.
 
The cleverly constructed latch which Clayton had made for
the door had sprung as Kerchak passed out; nor could the
apes find means of ingress through the heavily barred windows.
 
After roaming about the vicinity for a short time, they
started back for the deeper forests and the higher land from
whence they had come.
 
Kala had not once come to earth with her little adopted
babe, but now Kerchak called to her to descend with the rest,
and as there was no note of anger in his voice she dropped
lightly from branch to branch and joined the others on their
homeward march.
 
Those of the apes who attempted to examine Kala's
strange baby were repulsed with bared fangs and low
menacing growls, accompanied by words of warning from Kala.
 
When they assured her that they meant the child no harm
she permitted them to come close, but would not allow them
to touch her charge.
 
It was as though she knew that her baby was frail and delicate
and feared lest the rough hands of her fellows might injure
the little thing.
 
Another thing she did, and which made traveling an onerous
trial for her.  Remembering the death of her own little
one, she clung desperately to the new babe, with one hand,
whenever they were upon the march.
 
The other young rode upon their mothers' backs; their little
arms tightly clasping the hairy necks before them, while
their legs were locked beneath their mothers' armpits.
 
Not so with Kala; she held the small form of the little
Lord Greystoke tightly to her breast, where the dainty hands
clutched the long black hair which covered that portion of
her body.  She had seen one child fall from her back to a
terrible death, and she would take no further chances with this.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
Tenderly Kala nursed her little waif, wondering silently
why it did not gain strength and agility as did the little
apes of other mothers.  It was nearly a year from the time the
little fellow came into her possession before he would walk
alone, and as for climbing--my, but how stupid he was!
 
Kala sometimes talked with the older females about her
young hopeful, but none of them could understand how a
child could be so slow and backward in learning to care for
itself.  Why, it could not even find food alone, and more
than twelve moons had passed since Kala had come upon it.
 
Had they known that the child had seen thirteen moons
before it had come into Kala's possession they would have
considered its case as absolutely hopeless, for the little apes
of their own tribe were as far advanced in two or three
moons as was this little stranger after twenty-five.
 
Tublat, Kala's husband, was sorely vexed, and but for the female's
careful watching would have put the child out of the way.
 
"He will never be a great ape," he argued.  "Always will
you have to carry him and protect him.  What good will he be
to the tribe?  None; only a burden.
 
"Let us leave him quietly sleeping among the tall grasses,
that you may bear other and stronger apes to guard us in our
old age."
 
"Never, Broken Nose," replied Kala.  "If I must carry him
forever, so be it."
 
And then Tublat went to Kerchak to urge him to use his
authority with Kala, and force her to give up little Tarzan,
which was the name they had given to the tiny Lord Greystoke,
and which meant "White-Skin."
 
But when Kerchak spoke to her about it Kala threatened
to run away from the tribe if they did not leave her in peace
with the child; and as this is one of the inalienable rights of
the jungle folk, if they be dissatisfied among their own people,
they bothered her no more, for Kala was a fine clean-limbed
young female, and they did not wish to lose her.
 
As Tarzan grew he made more rapid strides, so that by the
time he was ten years old he was an excellent climber, and on
the ground could do many wonderful things which were beyond
the powers of his little brothers and sisters.
 
In many ways did he differ from them, and they often
marveled at his superior cunning, but in strength and size he
was deficient; for at ten the great anthropoids were fully
grown, some of them towering over six feet in height, while
little Tarzan was still but a half-grown boy.
 
Yet such a boy!
 
From early childhood he had used his hands to swing from
branch to branch after the manner of his giant mother, and
as he grew older he spent hour upon hour daily speeding
through the tree tops with his brothers and sisters.
 
He could spring twenty feet across space at the dizzy
heights of the forest top, and grasp with unerring precision,
and without apparent jar, a limb waving wildly in the path of
an approaching tornado.
 
He could drop twenty feet at a stretch from limb to limb
in rapid descent to the ground, or he could gain the utmost
pinnacle of the loftiest tropical giant with the ease and
swiftness of a squirrel.
 
Though but ten years old he was fully as strong as the
average man of thirty, and far more agile than the most
practiced athlete ever becomes.  And day by day his strength
was increasing.
 
His life among these fierce apes had been happy; for his
recollection held no other life, nor did he know that there
existed within the universe aught else than his little forest
and the wild jungle animals with which he was familiar.
 
He was nearly ten before he commenced to realize that a
great difference existed between himself and his fellows.  His
little body, burned brown by exposure, suddenly caused him
feelings of intense shame, for he realized that it was entirely
hairless, like some low snake, or other reptile.
 
He attempted to obviate this by plastering himself from
head to foot with mud, but this dried and fell off.  Besides it
felt so uncomfortable that he quickly decided that he
preferred the shame to the discomfort.
 
In the higher land which his tribe frequented was a little
lake, and it was here that Tarzan first saw his face in the
clear, still waters of its bosom.
 
It was on a sultry day of the dry season that he and one of
his cousins had gone down to the bank to drink.  As they
leaned over, both little faces were mirrored on the placid
pool; the fierce and terrible features of the ape beside those
of the aristocratic scion of an old English house.
 
Tarzan was appalled.  It had been bad enough to be hairless,
but to own such a countenance!  He wondered that the
other apes could look at him at all.
 
That tiny slit of a mouth and those puny white teeth!  How
they looked beside the mighty lips and powerful fangs of his
more fortunate brothers!
 
And the little pinched nose of his; so thin was it that it
looked half starved.  He turned red as he compared it with the
beautiful broad nostrils of his companion.  Such a generous nose!
Why it spread half across his face!  It certainly must be
fine to be so handsome, thought poor little Tarzan.
 
But when he saw his own eyes; ah, that was the final blow
--a brown spot, a gray circle and then blank whiteness!
Frightful! not even the snakes had such hideous eyes as he.
 
So intent was he upon this personal appraisement of his
features that he did not hear the parting of the tall grass
behind him as a great body pushed itself stealthily through
the jungle; nor did his companion, the ape, hear either, for
he was drinking and the noise of his sucking lips and gurgles
of satisfaction drowned the quiet approach of the intruder.
 
Not thirty paces behind the two she crouched--Sabor, the
huge lioness--lashing her tail.  Cautiously she moved a great
padded paw forward, noiselessly placing it before she lifted
the next.  Thus she advanced; her belly low, almost touching
the surface of the ground--a great cat preparing to spring
upon its prey.
 
Now she was within ten feet of the two unsuspecting little
playfellows--carefully she drew her hind feet well up beneath
her body, the great muscles rolling under the beautiful skin.
 
So low she was crouching now that she seemed flattened to
the earth except for the upward bend of the glossy back as it
gathered for the spring.
 
No longer the tail lashed--quiet and straight behind her it lay.
 
An instant she paused thus, as though turned to stone, and
then, with an awful scream, she sprang.
 
Sabor, the lioness, was a wise hunter.  To one less wise the
wild alarm of her fierce cry as she sprang would have seemed
a foolish thing, for could she not more surely have fallen upon
her victims had she but quietly leaped without that loud shriek?
 
But Sabor knew well the wondrous quickness of the jungle
folk and their almost unbelievable powers of hearing.  To
them the sudden scraping of one blade of grass across
another was as effectual a warning as her loudest cry, and
Sabor knew that she could not make that mighty leap without
a little noise.
 
Her wild scream was not a warning.  It was voiced to
freeze her poor victims in a paralysis of terror for the tiny
fraction of an instant which would suffice for her mighty
claws to sink into their soft flesh and hold them beyond hope
of escape.
 
So far as the ape was concerned, Sabor reasoned correctly.
The little fellow crouched trembling just an instant, but that
instant was quite long enough to prove his undoing.
 
Not so, however, with Tarzan, the man-child.  His life
amidst the dangers of the jungle had taught him to meet
emergencies with self-confidence, and his higher intelligence
resulted in a quickness of mental action far beyond the powers
of the apes.
 
So the scream of Sabor, the lioness, galvanized the brain
and muscles of little Tarzan into instant action.
 
Before him lay the deep waters of the little lake, behind
him certain death; a cruel death beneath tearing claws and
rending fangs.
 
Tarzan had always hated water except as a medium for
quenching his thirst.  He hated it because he connected it with
the chill and discomfort of the torrential rains, and he feared
it for the thunder and lightning and wind which accompanied them.
 
The deep waters of the lake he had been taught by his wild
mother to avoid, and further, had he not seen little Neeta
sink beneath its quiet surface only a few short weeks before
never to return to the tribe?
 
But of the two evils his quick mind chose the lesser ere the
first note of Sabor's scream had scarce broken the quiet of
the jungle, and before the great beast had covered half her
leap Tarzan felt the chill waters close above his head.
 
He could not swim, and the water was very deep; but still he
lost no particle of that self-confidence and resourcefulness
which were the badges of his superior being.
 
Rapidly he moved his hands and feet in an attempt to
scramble upward, and, possibly more by chance than design,
he fell into the stroke that a dog uses when swimming, so
that within a few seconds his nose was above water and he
found that he could keep it there by continuing his strokes,
and also make progress through the water.
 
He was much surprised and pleased with this new acquirement
which had been so suddenly thrust upon him, but he had no
time for thinking much upon it.
 
He was now swimming parallel to the bank and there he
saw the cruel beast that would have seized him crouching
upon the still form of his little playmate.
 
The lioness was intently watching Tarzan, evidently expecting
him to return to shore, but this the boy had no intention
of doing.
 
Instead he raised his voice in the call of distress common
to his tribe, adding to it the warning which would prevent
would-be rescuers from running into the clutches of Sabor.
 
Almost immediately there came an answer from the distance,
and presently forty or fifty great apes swung rapidly and
majestically through the trees toward the scene of tragedy.
 
In the lead was Kala, for she had recognized the tones of
her best beloved, and with her was the mother of the little
ape who lay dead beneath cruel Sabor.
 
Though more powerful and better equipped for fighting than
the apes, the lioness had no desire to meet these enraged
adults, and with a snarl of hatred she sprang quickly
into the brush and disappeared.
 
Tarzan now swam to shore and clambered quickly upon
dry land.  The feeling of freshness and exhilaration which the
cool waters had imparted to him, filled his little being with
grateful surprise, and ever after he lost no opportunity to
take a daily plunge in lake or stream or ocean when it was
possible to do so.
 
For a long time Kala could not accustom herself to the
sight; for though her people could swim when forced to it,
they did not like to enter water, and never did so voluntarily.
 
The adventure with the lioness gave Tarzan food for
pleasurable memories, for it was such affairs which broke
the monotony of his daily life--otherwise but a dull round of
searching for food, eating, and sleeping.
 
The tribe to which he belonged roamed a tract extending,
roughly, twenty-five miles along the seacoast and some fifty
miles inland.  This they traversed almost continually,
occasionally remaining for months in one locality; but as they
moved through the trees with great speed they often covered
the territory in a very few days.
 
Much depended upon food supply, climatic conditions, and
the prevalence of animals of the more dangerous species;
though Kerchak often led them on long marches for no other
reason than that he had tired of remaining in the same place.
 
At night they slept where darkness overtook them, lying
upon the ground, and sometimes covering their heads, and
more seldom their bodies, with the great leaves of the
elephant's ear.  Two or three might lie cuddled in each other's
arms for additional warmth if the night were chill, and thus
Tarzan had slept in Kala's arms nightly for all these years.
 
That the huge, fierce brute loved this child of another race
is beyond question, and he, too, gave to the great, hairy beast
all the affection that would have belonged to his fair young
mother had she lived.
 
When he was disobedient she cuffed him, it is true, but she
was never cruel to him, and was more often caressing him
than chastising him.
 
Tublat, her mate, always hated Tarzan, and on several
occasions had come near ending his youthful career.
 
Tarzan on his part never lost an opportunity to show that
he fully reciprocated his foster father's sentiments, and
whenever he could safely annoy him or make faces at him or hurl
insults upon him from the safety of his mother's arms, or the
slender branches of the higher trees, he did so.
 
His superior intelligence and cunning permitted him to invent
a thousand diabolical tricks to add to the burdens of
Tublat's life.
 
Early in his boyhood he had learned to form ropes by
twisting and tying long grasses together, and with these he
was forever tripping Tublat or attempting to hang him from
some overhanging branch.
 
By constant playing and experimenting with these he learned
to tie rude knots, and make sliding nooses; and with these he
and the younger apes amused themselves.  What Tarzan did they
tried to do also, but he alone originated and became proficient.
 
One day while playing thus Tarzan had thrown his rope at
one of his fleeing companions, retaining the other end in his
grasp.  By accident the noose fell squarely about the running
ape's neck, bringing him to a sudden and surprising halt.
 
Ah, here was a new game, a fine game, thought Tarzan, and
immediately he attempted to repeat the trick.  And thus, by
painstaking and continued practice, he learned the art of roping.
 
Now, indeed, was the life of Tublat a living nightmare.  In
sleep, upon the march, night or day, he never knew when
that quiet noose would slip about his neck and nearly choke
the life out of him.
 
Kala punished, Tublat swore dire vengeance, and old Kerchak
took notice and warned and threatened; but all to no avail.
 
Tarzan defied them all, and the thin, strong noose continued
to settle about Tublat's neck whenever he least expected it.
 
The other apes derived unlimited amusement from Tublat's
discomfiture, for Broken Nose was a disagreeable old fellow,
whom no one liked, anyway.
 
In Tarzan's clever little mind many thoughts revolved, and
back of these was his divine power of reason.
 
If he could catch his fellow apes with his long arm of
many grasses, why not Sabor, the lioness?
 
It was the germ of a thought, which, however, was destined
to mull around in his conscious and subconscious mind
until it resulted in magnificent achievement.
 
But that came in later years.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
The wanderings of the tribe brought them often near the
closed and silent cabin by the little land-locked harbor.
To Tarzan this was always a source of never-ending mystery
and pleasure.
 
He would peek into the curtained windows, or, climbing
upon the roof, peer down the black depths of the chimney in
vain endeavor to solve the unknown wonders that lay within
those strong walls.
 
His child-like imagination pictured wonderful creatures
within, and the very impossibility of forcing entrance
added a thousandfold to his desire to do so.
 
He could clamber about the roof and windows for hours
attempting to discover means of ingress, but to the door he paid
little attention, for this was apparently as solid as the walls.
 
It was in the next visit to the vicinity, following the
adventure with old Sabor, that, as he approached the cabin,
Tarzan noticed that from a distance the door appeared to be an
independent part of the wall in which it was set, and for the first
time it occurred to him that this might prove the means of
entrance which had so long eluded him.
 
He was alone, as was often the case when he visited the
cabin, for the apes had no love for it; the story of the
thunder-stick having lost nothing in the telling during these
ten years had quite surrounded the white man's deserted abode
with an atmosphere of weirdness and terror for the simians.
 
The story of his own connection with the cabin had never
been told him.  The language of the apes had so few words
that they could talk but little of what they had seen in the
cabin, having no words to accurately describe either the
strange people or their belongings, and so, long before
Tarzan was old enough to understand, the subject had been
forgotten by the tribe.
 
Only in a dim, vague way had Kala explained to him that
his father had been a strange white ape, but he did not know
that Kala was not his own mother.
 
On this day, then, he went directly to the door and spent
hours examining it and fussing with the hinges, the knob and
the latch.  Finally he stumbled upon the right combination,
and the door swung creakingly open before his astonished eyes.
 
For some minutes he did not dare venture within, but finally,
as his eyes became accustomed to the dim light of the
interior he slowly and cautiously entered.
 
In the middle of the floor lay a skeleton, every vestige of
flesh gone from the bones to which still clung the mildewed
and moldered remnants of what had once been clothing.
Upon the bed lay a similar gruesome thing, but smaller, while
in a tiny cradle near-by was a third, a wee mite of a skeleton.
 
To none of these evidences of a fearful tragedy of a long
dead day did little Tarzan give but passing heed.  His wild
jungle life had inured him to the sight of dead and dying
animals, and had he known that he was looking upon the remains
of his own father and mother he would have been no more
greatly moved.
 
The furnishings and other contents of the room it was
which riveted his attention.  He examined many things
minutely--strange tools and weapons, books, paper, clothing--
what little had withstood the ravages of time in the humid
atmosphere of the jungle coast.
 
He opened chests and cupboards, such as did not baffle his
small experience, and in these he found the contents much
better preserved.
 
Among other things he found a sharp hunting knife, on the
keen blade of which he immediately proceeded to cut his
finger.  Undaunted he continued his experiments, finding that
he could hack and hew splinters of wood from the table and
chairs with this new toy.
 
For a long time this amused him, but finally tiring he
continued his explorations.  In a cupboard filled with books
he came across one with brightly colored pictures--it was a
child's illustrated alphabet--
 
              A is for Archer
              Who shoots with a bow.
              B is for Boy,
              His first name is Joe.
 
 
The pictures interested him greatly.
 
There were many apes with faces similar to his own, and
further over in the book he found, under "M," some little
monkeys such as he saw daily flitting through the trees of his
primeval forest.  But nowhere was pictured any of his own
people; in all the book was none that resembled Kerchak, or
Tublat, or Kala.
 
At first he tried to pick the little figures from the leaves,
but he soon saw that they were not real, though he knew not
what they might be, nor had he any words to describe them.
 
The boats, and trains, and cows and horses were quite
meaningless to him, but not quite so baffling as the odd little
figures which appeared beneath and between the colored
pictures--some strange kind of bug he thought they might be,
for many of them had legs though nowhere could he find one
with eyes and a mouth.  It was his first introduction to the
letters of the alphabet, and he was over ten years old.
 
Of course he had never before seen print, or ever had
spoken with any living thing which had the remotest idea that
such a thing as a written language existed, nor ever had he
seen anyone reading.
 
So what wonder that the little boy was quite at a loss to
guess the meaning of these strange figures.
 
Near the middle of the book he found his old enemy,
Sabor, the lioness, and further on, coiled Histah, the snake.
 
Oh, it was most engrossing!  Never before in all his ten
years had he enjoyed anything so much.  So absorbed was he
that he did not note the approaching dusk, until it was quite
upon him and the figures were blurred.
 
He put the book back in the cupboard and closed the door,
for he did not wish anyone else to find and destroy his
treasure, and as he went out into the gathering darkness he closed
the great door of the cabin behind him as it had been before
he discovered the secret of its lock, but before he left he had
noticed the hunting knife lying where he had thrown it upon
the floor, and this he picked up and took with him to show to
his fellows.
 
He had taken scarce a dozen steps toward the jungle when
a great form rose up before him from the shadows of a low
bush.  At first he thought it was one of his own people but in
another instant he realized that it was Bolgani, the huge gorilla.
 
So close was he that there was no chance for flight and
little Tarzan knew that he must stand and fight for his life;
for these great beasts were the deadly enemies of his tribe, and
neither one nor the other ever asked or gave quarter.
 
Had Tarzan been a full-grown bull ape of the species of
his tribe he would have been more than a match for the gorilla,
but being only a little English boy, though enormously
muscular for such, he stood no chance against his cruel
antagonist.  In his veins, though, flowed the blood of the best
of a race of mighty fighters, and back of this was the training
of his short lifetime among the fierce brutes of the jungle.
 
He knew no fear, as we know it; his little heart beat the
faster but from the excitement and exhilaration of adventure.
Had the opportunity presented itself he would have escaped,
but solely because his judgment told him he was no match
for the great thing which confronted him.  And since reason
showed him that successful flight was impossible he met the
gorilla squarely and bravely without a tremor of a single
muscle, or any sign of panic.
 
In fact he met the brute midway in its charge, striking its
huge body with his closed fists and as futilely as he had been
a fly attacking an elephant.  But in one hand he still clutched
the knife he had found in the cabin of his father, and as the
brute, striking and biting, closed upon him the boy accidentally
turned the point toward the hairy breast.  As the knife
sank deep into its body the gorilla shrieked in pain and rage.
 
But the boy had learned in that brief second a use for his
sharp and shining toy, so that, as the tearing, striking beast
dragged him to earth he plunged the blade repeatedly and to
the hilt into its breast.
 
The gorilla, fighting after the manner of its kind, struck
terrific blows with its open hand, and tore the flesh at the
boy's throat and chest with its mighty tusks.
 
For a moment they rolled upon the ground in the fierce
frenzy of combat.  More and more weakly the torn and bleeding
arm struck home with the long sharp blade, then the little
figure stiffened with a spasmodic jerk, and Tarzan, the young
Lord Greystoke, rolled unconscious upon the dead and decaying
vegetation which carpeted his jungle home.
 
A mile back in the forest the tribe had heard the fierce
challenge of the gorilla, and, as was his custom when any
danger threatened, Kerchak called his people together, partly
for mutual protection against a common enemy, since this
gorilla might be but one of a party of several, and also to see
that all members of the tribe were accounted for.
 
It was soon discovered that Tarzan was missing, and Tublat
was strongly opposed to sending assistance.  Kerchak himself
had no liking for the strange little waif, so he listened to
Tublat, and, finally, with a shrug of his shoulders, turned
back to the pile of leaves on which he had made his bed.
 
But Kala was of a different mind; in fact, she had not
waited but to learn that Tarzan was absent ere she was fairly
flying through the matted branches toward the point from
which the cries of the gorilla were still plainly audible.
 
Darkness had now fallen, and an early moon was sending
its faint light to cast strange, grotesque shadows among the
dense foliage of the forest.
 
Here and there the brilliant rays penetrated to earth, but
for the most part they only served to accentuate the Stygian
blackness of the jungle's depths.
 
Like some huge phantom, Kala swung noiselessly from
tree to tree; now running nimbly along a great branch, now
swinging through space at the end of another, only to grasp
that of a farther tree in her rapid progress toward the scene
of the tragedy her knowledge of jungle life told her was being
enacted a short distance before her.
 
The cries of the gorilla proclaimed that it was in mortal
combat with some other denizen of the fierce wood.  Suddenly
these cries ceased, and the silence of death reigned throughout
the jungle.
 
Kala could not understand, for the voice of Bolgani had at
last been raised in the agony of suffering and death, but
no sound had come to her by which she possibly could determine
the nature of his antagonist.
 
That her little Tarzan could destroy a great bull gorilla she
knew to be improbable, and so, as she neared the spot from
which the sounds of the struggle had come, she moved more
warily and at last slowly and with extreme caution she
traversed the lowest branches, peering eagerly into the moon-
splashed blackness for a sign of the combatants.
 
Presently she came upon them, lying in a little open space
full under the brilliant light of the moon--little Tarzan's torn
and bloody form, and beside it a great bull gorilla, stone dead.
 
With a low cry Kala rushed to Tarzan's side, and gathering the
poor, blood-covered body to her breast, listened for a sign of
life.  Faintly she heard it--the weak beating of the little heart.
 
Tenderly she bore him back through the inky jungle to
where the tribe lay, and for many days and nights she sat
guard beside him, bringing him food and water, and brushing
the flies and other insects from his cruel wounds.
 
Of medicine or surgery the poor thing knew nothing.  She
could but lick the wounds, and thus she kept them cleansed,
that healing nature might the more quickly do her work.
 
At first Tarzan would eat nothing, but rolled and tossed in
a wild delirium of fever.  All he craved was water, and this
she brought him in the only way she could, bearing it in her
own mouth.
 
No human mother could have shown more unselfish and
sacrificing devotion than did this poor, wild brute for the
little orphaned waif whom fate had thrown into her keeping.
 
At last the fever abated and the boy commenced to mend.
No word of complaint passed his tight set lips, though the
pain of his wounds was excruciating.
 
A portion of his chest was laid bare to the ribs, three of
which had been broken by the mighty blows of the gorilla.
One arm was nearly severed by the giant fangs, and a great
piece had been torn from his neck, exposing his jugular vein,
which the cruel jaws had missed but by a miracle.
 
With the stoicism of the brutes who had raised him he endured
his suffering quietly, preferring to crawl away from the
others and lie huddled in some clump of tall grasses rather
than to show his misery before their eyes.
 
Kala, alone, he was glad to have with him, but now that he
was better she was gone longer at a time, in search of food;
for the devoted animal had scarcely eaten enough to support
her own life while Tarzan had been so low, and was in
consequence, reduced to a mere shadow of her former self.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
After what seemed an eternity to the little sufferer he was
able to walk once more, and from then on his recovery
was so rapid that in another month he was as strong and
active as ever.
 
During his convalescence he had gone over in his mind
many times the battle with the gorilla, and his first thought
was to recover the wonderful little weapon which had transformed
him from a hopelessly outclassed weakling to the superior
of the mighty terror of the jungle.
 
Also, he was anxious to return to the cabin and continue
his investigations of its wondrous contents.
 
So, early one morning, he set forth alone upon his quest.
After a little search he located the clean-picked bones of his
late adversary, and close by, partly buried beneath the fallen
leaves, he found the knife, now red with rust from its exposure
to the dampness of the ground and from the dried blood
of the gorilla.
 
He did not like the change in its former bright and gleaming
surface; but it was still a formidable weapon, and one
which he meant to use to advantage whenever the opportunity
presented itself.  He had in mind that no more would he
run from the wanton attacks of old Tublat.
 
In another moment he was at the cabin, and after a short
time had again thrown the latch and entered.  His first concern
was to learn the mechanism of the lock, and this he did
by examining it closely while the door was open, so that he
could learn precisely what caused it to hold the door, and by
what means it released at his touch.
 
He found that he could close and lock the door from
within, and this he did so that there would be no chance
of his being molested while at his investigation.
 
He commenced a systematic search of the cabin; but his
attention was soon riveted by the books which seemed to
exert a strange and powerful influence over him, so that he
could scarce attend to aught else for the lure of the wondrous
puzzle which their purpose presented to him.
 
Among the other books were a primer, some child's readers,
numerous picture books, and a great dictionary.  All of
these he examined, but the pictures caught his fancy most,
though the strange little bugs which covered the pages where
there were no pictures excited his wonder and deepest thought.
 
Squatting upon his haunches on the table top in the cabin
his father had built--his smooth, brown, naked little body
bent over the book which rested in his strong slender hands, and
his great shock of long, black hair falling about his well-
shaped head and bright, intelligent eyes--Tarzan of the apes,
little primitive man, presented a picture filled, at once, with
pathos and with promise--an allegorical figure of the primordial
groping through the black night of ignorance toward the
light of learning.
 
His little face was tense in study, for he had partially
grasped, in a hazy, nebulous way, the rudiments of a thought
which was destined to prove the key and the solution to the
puzzling problem of the strange little bugs.
 
In his hands was a primer opened at a picture of a little
ape similar to himself, but covered, except for hands and
face, with strange, colored fur, for such he thought the jacket
and trousers to be.  Beneath the picture were three little bugs--
 
              BOY.
 
 
And now he had discovered in the text upon the page that
these three were repeated many times in the same sequence.
 
Another fact he learned--that there were comparatively
few individual bugs; but these were repeated many times,
occasionally alone, but more often in company with others.
 
Slowly he turned the pages, scanning the pictures and the
text for a repetition of the combination B-O-Y.  Presently he
found it beneath a picture of another little ape and a strange
animal which went upon four legs like the jackal and resembled
him not a little.  Beneath this picture the bugs appeared as:
 
              A BOY AND A DOG
 
 
There they were, the three little bugs which always accompanied
the little ape.
 
And so he progressed very, very slowly, for it was a hard
and laborious task which he had set himself without knowing
it--a task which might seem to you or me impossible--learning
to read without having the slightest knowledge of letters or
written language, or the faintest idea that such things existed.
 
He did not accomplish it in a day, or in a week, or in a
month, or in a year; but slowly, very slowly, he learned after
he had grasped the possibilities which lay in those little bugs,
so that by the time he was fifteen he knew the various
combinations of letters which stood for every pictured figure
in the little primer and in one or two of the picture books.
 
Of the meaning and use of the articles and conjunctions, verbs
and adverbs and pronouns he had but the faintest conception.
 
One day when he was about twelve he found a number of
lead pencils in a hitherto undiscovered drawer beneath the
table, and in scratching upon the table top with one of them
he was delighted to discover the black line it left behind it.
 
He worked so assiduously with this new toy that the table
top was soon a mass of scrawly loops and irregular lines and
his pencil-point worn down to the wood.  Then he took another
pencil, but this time he had a definite object in view.
 
He would attempt to reproduce some of the little bugs that
scrambled over the pages of his books.
 
It was a difficult task, for he held the pencil as one would
grasp the hilt of a dagger, which does not add greatly to ease
in writing or to the legibility of the results.
 
But he persevered for months, at such times as he was able
to come to the cabin, until at last by repeated experimenting
he found a position in which to hold the pencil that best
permitted him to guide and control it, so that at last he could
roughly reproduce any of the little bugs.
 
Thus he made a beginning of writing.
 
Copying the bugs taught him another thing--their number;
and though he could not count as we understand it, yet he
had an idea of quantity, the base of his calculations being
the number of fingers upon one of his hands.
 
His search through the various books convinced him that
he had discovered all the different kinds of bugs most often
repeated in combination, and these he arranged in proper
order with great ease because of the frequency with which he
had perused the fascinating alphabet picture book.
 
His education progressed; but his greatest finds were in the
inexhaustible storehouse of the huge illustrated dictionary, for
he learned more through the medium of pictures than text,
even after he had grasped the significance of the bugs.
 
When he discovered the arrangement of words in alphabetical
order he delighted in searching for and finding the
combinations with which he was familiar, and the words which
followed them, their definitions, led him still further into the
mazes of erudition.
 
By the time he was seventeen he had learned to read the
simple, child's primer and had fully realized the true and
wonderful purpose of the little bugs.
 
No longer did he feel shame for his hairless body or his
human features, for now his reason told him that he was of a
different race from his wild and hairy companions.  He was a
M-A-N, they were A-P-E-S, and the little apes which scurried
through the forest top were M-O-N-K-E-Y-S.  He knew, too,
that old Sabor was a L-I-O-N-E-S-S, and Histah a S-N-A-K-E,
and Tantor an E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T.  And so he learned to read.
From then on his progress was rapid.  With the help of the
great dictionary and the active intelligence of a healthy mind
endowed by inheritance with more than ordinary reasoning
powers he shrewdly guessed at much which he could not
really understand, and more often than not his guesses were
close to the mark of truth.
 
There were many breaks in his education, caused by the
migratory habits of his tribe, but even when removed from
his books his active brain continued to search out the
mysteries of his fascinating avocation.
 
Pieces of bark and flat leaves and even smooth stretches of
bare earth provided him with copy books whereon to scratch
with the point of his hunting knife the lessons he was learning.
 
Nor did he neglect the sterner duties of life while following
the bent of his inclination toward the solving of the mystery
of his library.
 
He practiced with his rope and played with his sharp knife,
which he had learned to keep keen by whetting upon flat stones.
 
The tribe had grown larger since Tarzan had come among
them, for under the leadership of Kerchak they had been
able to frighten the other tribes from their part of the jungle
so that they had plenty to eat and little or no loss from
predatory incursions of neighbors.
 
Hence the younger males as they became adult found it
more comfortable to take mates from their own tribe, or if
they captured one of another tribe to bring her back to
Kerchak's band and live in amity with him rather than attempt
to set up new establishments of their own, or fight with the
redoubtable Kerchak for supremacy at home.
 
Occasionally one more ferocious than his fellows would
attempt this latter alternative, but none had come yet who
could wrest the palm of victory from the fierce and brutal ape.
 
Tarzan held a peculiar position in the tribe.  They seemed
to consider him one of them and yet in some way different.
The older males either ignored him entirely or else hated him
so vindictively that but for his wondrous agility and speed
and the fierce protection of the huge Kala he would have
been dispatched at an early age.
 
Tublat was his most consistent enemy, but it was through
Tublat that, when he was about thirteen, the persecution of
his enemies suddenly ceased and he was left severely alone,
except on the occasions when one of them ran amuck in the
throes of one of those strange, wild fits of insane rage which
attacks the males of many of the fiercer animals of the jungle.
Then none was safe.
 
On the day that Tarzan established his right to respect, the
tribe was gathered about a small natural amphitheater which
the jungle had left free from its entangling vines and creepers
in a hollow among some low hills.
 
The open space was almost circular in shape.  Upon every
hand rose the mighty giants of the untouched forest, with the
matted undergrowth banked so closely between the huge
trunks that the only opening into the little, level arena was
through the upper branches of the trees.
 
Here, safe from interruption, the tribe often gathered.  In
the center of the amphitheater was one of those strange
earthen drums which the anthropoids build for the queer rites
the sounds of which men have heard in the fastnesses of the
jungle, but which none has ever witnessed.
 
Many travelers have seen the drums of the great apes, and
some have heard the sounds of their beating and the noise of
the wild, weird revelry of these first lords of the jungle, but
Tarzan, Lord Greystoke, is, doubtless, the only human being
who ever joined in the fierce, mad, intoxicating revel of the
Dum-Dum.
 
From this primitive function has arisen, unquestionably, all
the forms and ceremonials of modern church and state, for
through all the countless ages, back beyond the uttermost
ramparts of a dawning humanity our fierce, hairy forebears
danced out the rites of the Dum-Dum to the sound of their
earthen drums, beneath the bright light of a tropical moon in
the depth of a mighty jungle which stands unchanged today
as it stood on that long forgotten night in the dim, unthinkable
vistas of the long dead past when our first shaggy ancestor
swung from a swaying bough and dropped lightly upon
the soft turf of the first meeting place.
 
On the day that Tarzan won his emancipation from the
persecution that had followed him remorselessly for twelve of
his thirteen years of life, the tribe, now a full hundred strong,
trooped silently through the lower terrace of the jungle trees
and dropped noiselessly upon the floor of the amphitheater.
 
The rites of the Dum-Dum marked important events in the
life of the tribe--a victory, the capture of a prisoner, the
killing of some large fierce denizen of the jungle, the death or
accession of a king, and were conducted with set ceremonialism.
 
Today it was the killing of a giant ape, a member of another
tribe, and as the people of Kerchak entered the arena
two mighty bulls were seen bearing the body of the
vanquished between them.
 
They laid their burden before the earthen drum and then
squatted there beside it as guards, while the other members of
the community curled themselves in grassy nooks to sleep
until the rising moon should give the signal for the
commencement of their savage orgy.
 
For hours absolute quiet reigned in the little clearing,
except as it was broken by the discordant notes of brilliantly
feathered parrots, or the screeching and twittering of the
thousand jungle birds flitting ceaselessly amongst the vivid
orchids and flamboyant blossoms which festooned the myriad,
moss-covered branches of the forest kings.
 
At length as darkness settled upon the jungle the apes
commenced to bestir themselves, and soon they formed a great
circle about the earthen drum.  The females and young squatted
in a thin line at the outer periphery of the circle, while
just in front of them ranged the adult males.  Before the drum
sat three old females, each armed with a knotted branch fifteen
or eighteen inches in length.
 
Slowly and softly they began tapping upon the resounding
surface of the drum as the first faint rays of the ascending
moon silvered the encircling tree tops.
 
As the light in the amphitheater increased the females
augmented the frequency and force of their blows until presently
a wild, rhythmic din pervaded the great jungle for miles in
every direction.  Huge, fierce brutes stopped in their hunting,
with up-pricked ears and raised heads, to listen to the dull
booming that betokened the Dum-Dum of the apes.
 
Occasionally one would raise his shrill scream or thunderous
roar in answering challenge to the savage din of the
anthropoids, but none came near to investigate or attack, for
the great apes, assembled in all the power of their numbers,
filled the breasts of their jungle neighbors with deep respect.
 
As the din of the drum rose to almost deafening volume
Kerchak sprang into the open space between the squatting
males and the drummers.
 
Standing erect he threw his head far back and looking full
into the eye of the rising moon he beat upon his breast with
his great hairy paws and emitted his fearful roaring shriek.
 
One--twice--thrice that terrifying cry rang out across the
teeming solitude of that unspeakably quick, yet unthinkably
dead, world.
 
Then, crouching, Kerchak slunk noiselessly around the
open circle, veering far away from the dead body lying before
the altar-drum, but, as he passed, keeping his little,
fierce, wicked, red eyes upon the corpse.
 
Another male then sprang into the arena, and, repeating
the horrid cries of his king, followed stealthily in his wake.
Another and another followed in quick succession until the
jungle reverberated with the now almost ceaseless notes of
their bloodthirsty screams.
 
It was the challenge and the hunt.
 
When all the adult males had joined in the thin line of
circling dancers the attack commenced.
 
Kerchak, seizing a huge club from the pile which lay at
hand for the purpose, rushed furiously upon the dead ape,
dealing the corpse a terrific blow, at the same time emitting
the growls and snarls of combat.  The din of the drum was
now increased, as well as the frequency of the blows, and the
warriors, as each approached the victim of the hunt and
delivered his bludgeon blow, joined in the mad whirl of the
Death Dance.
 
Tarzan was one of the wild, leaping horde.  His brown,
sweat-streaked, muscular body, glistening in the moonlight,
shone supple and graceful among the uncouth, awkward,
hairy brutes about him.
 
None was more stealthy in the mimic hunt, none more
ferocious than he in the wild ferocity of the attack, none
who leaped so high into the air in the Dance of Death.
 
As the noise and rapidity of the drumbeats increased the
dancers apparently became intoxicated with the wild rhythm
and the savage yells.  Their leaps and bounds increased, their
bared fangs dripped saliva, and their lips and breasts were
flecked with foam.
 
For half an hour the weird dance went on, until, at a sign
from Kerchak, the noise of the drums ceased, the female
drummers scampering hurriedly through the line of dancers
toward the outer rim of squatting spectators.  Then, as one,
the males rushed headlong upon the thing which their terrific
blows had reduced to a mass of hairy pulp.
 
Flesh seldom came to their jaws in satisfying quantities, so
a fit finale to their wild revel was a taste of fresh killed meat,
and it was to the purpose of devouring their late enemy that
they now turned their attention.
 
Great fangs sunk into the carcass tearing away huge hunks,
the mightiest of the apes obtaining the choicest morsels,
while the weaker circled the outer edge of the fighting,
snarling pack awaiting their chance to dodge in and snatch a
dropped tidbit or filch a remaining bone before all was gone.
 
Tarzan, more than the apes, craved and needed flesh.
Descended from a race of meat eaters, never in his life, he
thought, had he once satisfied his appetite for animal food;
and so now his agile little body wormed its way far into the
mass of struggling, rending apes in an endeavor to obtain a
share which his strength would have been unequal to the task
of winning for him.
 
At his side hung the hunting knife of his unknown father
in a sheath self-fashioned in copy of one he had seen among
the pictures of his treasure-books.
 
At last he reached the fast disappearing feast and with his
sharp knife slashed off a more generous portion than he had
hoped for, an entire hairy forearm, where it protruded from
beneath the feet of the mighty Kerchak, who was so busily
engaged in perpetuating the royal prerogative of gluttony that
he failed to note the act of LESE-MAJESTE.
 
So little Tarzan wriggled out from beneath the struggling
mass, clutching his grisly prize close to his breast.
 
Among those circling futilely the outskirts of the banqueters
was old Tublat.  He had been among the first at the feast,
but had retreated with a goodly share to eat in quiet, and was
now forcing his way back for more.
 
So it was that he spied Tarzan as the boy emerged from
the clawing, pushing throng with that hairy forearm hugged
firmly to his body.
 
Tublat's little, close-set, bloodshot, pig-eyes shot wicked
gleams of hate as they fell upon the object of his loathing.  In
them, too, was greed for the toothsome dainty the boy carried.
 
But Tarzan saw his arch enemy as quickly, and divining
what the great beast would do he leaped nimbly away toward
the females and the young, hoping to hide himself among
them.  Tublat, however, was close upon his heels, so that he
had no opportunity to seek a place of concealment, but saw
that he would be put to it to escape at all.
 
Swiftly he sped toward the surrounding trees and with an
agile bound gained a lower limb with one hand, and then,
transferring his burden to his teeth, he climbed rapidly
upward, closely followed by Tublat.
 
Up, up he went to the waving pinnacle of a lofty monarch
of the forest where his heavy pursuer dared not follow him.
There he perched, hurling taunts and insults at the raging,
foaming beast fifty feet below him.
 
And then Tublat went mad.
 
With horrifying screams and roars he rushed to the
ground, among the females and young, sinking his great
fangs into a dozen tiny necks and tearing great pieces from
the backs and breasts of the females who fell into his
clutches.
 
In the brilliant moonlight Tarzan witnessed the whole mad
carnival of rage.  He saw the females and the young scamper
to the safety of the trees.  Then the great bulls in the center of
the arena felt the mighty fangs of their demented fellow, and
with one accord they melted into the black shadows of the
overhanging forest.
 
There was but one in the amphitheater beside Tublat, a
belated female running swiftly toward the tree where Tarzan
perched, and close behind her came the awful Tublat.
 
It was Kala, and as quickly as Tarzan saw that Tublat was
gaining on her he dropped with the rapidity of a falling
stone, from branch to branch, toward his foster mother.
 
Now she was beneath the overhanging limbs and close
above her crouched Tarzan, waiting the outcome of the race.
 
She leaped into the air grasping a low-hanging branch, but
almost over the head of Tublat, so nearly had he distanced
her.  She should have been safe now but there was a rending,
tearing sound, the branch broke and precipitated her full
upon the head of Tublat, knocking him to the ground.
 
Both were up in an instant, but as quick as they had been
Tarzan had been quicker, so that the infuriated bull found
himself facing the man-child who stood between him and Kala.
 
Nothing could have suited the fierce beast better, and with
a roar of triumph he leaped upon the little Lord Greystoke.
But his fangs never closed in that nut brown flesh.
 
A muscular hand shot out and grasped the hairy throat,
and another plunged a keen hunting knife a dozen times into
the broad breast.  Like lightning the blows fell, and only
ceased when Tarzan felt the limp form crumple beneath him.
 
As the body rolled to the ground Tarzan of the Apes
placed his foot upon the neck of his lifelong enemy and,
raising his eyes to the full moon, threw back his fierce young
head and voiced the wild and terrible cry of his people.
 
One by one the tribe swung down from their arboreal retreats
and formed a circle about Tarzan and his vanquished
foe.  When they had all come Tarzan turned toward them.
 
"I am Tarzan," he cried.  "I am a great killer.  Let all
respect Tarzan of the Apes and Kala, his mother.  There be
none among you as mighty as Tarzan.  Let his enemies beware."
 
Looking full into the wicked, red eyes of Kerchak, the
young Lord Greystoke beat upon his mighty breast and
screamed out once more his shrill cry of defiance.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
The morning after the Dum-Dum the tribe started slowly
back through the forest toward the coast.
 
The body of Tublat lay where it had fallen, for the people
of Kerchak do not eat their own dead.
 
The march was but a leisurely search for food.  Cabbage
palm and gray plum, pisang and scitamine they found in
abundance, with wild pineapple, and occasionally small mammals,
birds, eggs, reptiles, and insects.  The nuts they cracked
between their powerful jaws, or, if too hard, broke by pounding
between stones.
 
Once old Sabor, crossing their path, sent them scurrying to
the safety of the higher branches, for if she respected their
number and their sharp fangs, they on their part held her
cruel and mighty ferocity in equal esteem.
 
Upon a low-hanging branch sat Tarzan directly above the
majestic, supple body as it forged silently through the thick
jungle.  He hurled a pineapple at the ancient enemy of his
people.  The great beast stopped and, turning, eyed the
taunting figure above her.
 
With an angry lash of her tail she bared her yellow fangs,
curling her great lips in a hideous snarl that wrinkled her
bristling snout in serried ridges and closed her wicked eyes to
two narrow slits of rage and hatred.
 
With back-laid ears she looked straight into the eyes of
Tarzan of the Apes and sounded her fierce, shrill challenge.
And from the safety of his overhanging limb the ape-child
sent back the fearsome answer of his kind.
 
For a moment the two eyed each other in silence, and then
the great cat turned into the jungle, which swallowed her as
the ocean engulfs a tossed pebble.
 
But into the mind of Tarzan a great plan sprang.  He had
killed the fierce Tublat, so was he not therefore a mighty
fighter?  Now would he track down the crafty Sabor and slay
her likewise.  He would be a mighty hunter, also.
 
At the bottom of his little English heart beat the great desire
to cover his nakedness with CLOTHES for he had learned
from his picture books that all MEN were so covered, while
MONKEYS and APES and every other living thing went naked.
 
CLOTHES therefore, must be truly a badge of greatness; the
insignia of the superiority of MAN over all other animals, for
surely there could be no other reason for wearing the hideous
things.
 
Many moons ago, when he had been much smaller, he had
desired the skin of Sabor, the lioness, or Numa, the lion, or
Sheeta, the leopard to cover his hairless body that he might
no longer resemble hideous Histah, the snake; but now he
was proud of his sleek skin for it betokened his descent from
a mighty race, and the conflicting desires to go naked in
prideful proof of his ancestry, or to conform to the customs
of his own kind and wear hideous and uncomfortable apparel
found first one and then the other in the ascendency.
 
As the tribe continued their slow way through the forest
after the passing of Sabor, Tarzan's head was filled with
his great scheme for slaying his enemy, and for many days
thereafter he thought of little else.
 
On this day, however, he presently had other and more
immediate interests to attract his attention.
 
Suddenly it became as midnight; the noises of the jungle
ceased; the trees stood motionless as though in paralyzed
expectancy of some great and imminent disaster.  All nature
waited--but not for long.
 
Faintly, from a distance, came a low, sad moaning.  Nearer
and nearer it approached, mounting louder and louder in volume.
 
The great trees bent in unison as though pressed earthward
by a mighty hand.  Farther and farther toward the ground
they inclined, and still there was no sound save the deep and
awesome moaning of the wind.
 
Then, suddenly, the jungle giants whipped back, lashing
their mighty tops in angry and deafening protest.  A vivid and
blinding light flashed from the whirling, inky clouds above.
The deep cannonade of roaring thunder belched forth its fearsome
challenge.  The deluge came--all hell broke loose upon the jungle.
 
The tribe shivering from the cold rain, huddled at the bases
of great trees.  The lightning, darting and flashing through the
blackness, showed wildly waving branches, whipping streamers
and bending trunks.
 
Now and again some ancient patriarch of the woods, rent
by a flashing bolt, would crash in a thousand pieces among
the surrounding trees, carrying down numberless branches
and many smaller neighbors to add to the tangled confusion
of the tropical jungle.
 
Branches, great and small, torn away by the ferocity of the
tornado, hurtled through the wildly waving verdure, carrying
death and destruction to countless unhappy denizens of the
thickly peopled world below.
 
For hours the fury of the storm continued without surcease,
and still the tribe huddled close in shivering fear.
In constant danger from falling trunks and branches and
paralyzed by the vivid flashing of lightning and the
bellowing of thunder they crouched in pitiful misery until
the storm passed.
 
The end was as sudden as the beginning.  The wind ceased,
the sun shone forth--nature smiled once more.
 
The dripping leaves and branches, and the moist petals of
gorgeous flowers glistened in the splendor of the returning day.
And, so--as Nature forgot, her children forgot also.  Busy life
went on as it had been before the darkness and the fright.
 
But to Tarzan a dawning light had come to explain the
mystery of CLOTHES.  How snug he would have been beneath
the heavy coat of Sabor!  And so was added a further incentive
to the adventure.
 
For several months the tribe hovered near the beach where
stood Tarzan's cabin, and his studies took up the greater
portion of his time, but always when journeying through the
forest he kept his rope in readiness, and many were the smaller
animals that fell into the snare of the quick thrown noose.
 
Once it fell about the short neck of Horta, the boar, and
his mad lunge for freedom toppled Tarzan from the overhanging
limb where he had lain in wait and from whence he
had launched his sinuous coil.
 
The mighty tusker turned at the sound of his falling body,
and, seeing only the easy prey of a young ape, he lowered his
head and charged madly at the surprised youth.
 
Tarzan, happily, was uninjured by the fall, alighting catlike
upon all fours far outspread to take up the shock.  He was on
his feet in an instant and, leaping with the agility of the
monkey he was, he gained the safety of a low limb as Horta,
the boar, rushed futilely beneath.
 
Thus it was that Tarzan learned by experience the limitations
as well as the possibilities of his strange weapon.
 
He lost a long rope on this occasion, but he knew that had
it been Sabor who had thus dragged him from his perch the
outcome might have been very different, for he would have
lost his life, doubtless, into the bargain.
 
It took him many days to braid a new rope, but when,
finally, it was done he went forth purposely to hunt, and lie
in wait among the dense foliage of a great branch right above
the well-beaten trail that led to water.
 
Several small animals passed unharmed beneath him.  He did
not want such insignificant game.  It would take a strong
animal to test the efficacy of his new scheme.
 
At last came she whom Tarzan sought, with lithe sinews
rolling beneath shimmering hide; fat and glossy came Sabor,
the lioness.
 
Her great padded feet fell soft and noiseless on the narrow
trail.  Her head was high in ever alert attention; her long tail
moved slowly in sinuous and graceful undulations.
 
Nearer and nearer she came to where Tarzan of the Apes
crouched upon his limb, the coils of his long rope poised
ready in his hand.
 
Like a thing of bronze, motionless as death, sat Tarzan.
Sabor passed beneath.  One stride beyond she took--a second,
a third, and then the silent coil shot out above her.
 
For an instant the spreading noose hung above her head
like a great snake, and then, as she looked upward to detect
the origin of the swishing sound of the rope, it settled about
her neck.  With a quick jerk Tarzan snapped the noose tight
about the glossy throat, and then he dropped the rope and
clung to his support with both hands.
 
Sabor was trapped.
 
With a bound the startled beast turned into the jungle, but
Tarzan was not to lose another rope through the same cause
as the first.  He had learned from experience.  The lioness had
taken but half her second bound when she felt the rope
tighten about her neck; her body turned completely over in
the air and she fell with a heavy crash upon her back.  Tarzan
had fastened the end of the rope securely to the trunk of the
great tree on which he sat.
 
Thus far his plan had worked to perfection, but when he
grasped the rope, bracing himself behind a crotch of two
mighty branches, he found that dragging the mighty, struggling,
clawing, biting, screaming mass of iron-muscled fury up to
the tree and hanging her was a very different proposition.
 
The weight of old Sabor was immense, and when she braced
her huge paws nothing less than Tantor, the elephant,
himself, could have budged her.
 
The lioness was now back in the path where she could see
the author of the indignity which had been placed upon her.
Screaming with rage she suddenly charged, leaping high into
the air toward Tarzan, but when her huge body struck the
limb on which Tarzan had been, Tarzan was no longer there.
 
Instead he perched lightly upon a smaller branch twenty
feet above the raging captive.  For a moment Sabor hung half
across the branch, while Tarzan mocked, and hurled twigs
and branches at her unprotected face.
 
Presently the beast dropped to the earth again and Tarzan
came quickly to seize the rope, but Sabor had now found that
it was only a slender cord that held her, and grasping it in
her huge jaws severed it before Tarzan could tighten the
strangling noose a second time.
 
Tarzan was much hurt.  His well-laid plan had come to
naught, so he sat there screaming at the roaring creature
beneath him and making mocking grimaces at it.
 
Sabor paced back and forth beneath the tree for hours;
four times she crouched and sprang at the dancing sprite
above her, but might as well have clutched at the illusive
wind that murmured through the tree tops.
 
At last Tarzan tired of the sport, and with a parting roar
of challenge and a well-aimed ripe fruit that spread soft and
sticky over the snarling face of his enemy, he swung rapidly
through the trees, a hundred feet above the ground, and in a
short time was among the members of his tribe.
 
Here he recounted the details of his adventure, with swelling
chest and so considerable swagger that he quite impressed
even his bitterest enemies, while Kala fairly danced for joy
and pride.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
Tarzan of the Apes lived on in his wild, jungle existence
with little change for several years, only that he grew
stronger and wiser, and learned from his books more and
more of the strange worlds which lay somewhere outside his
primeval forest.
 
To him life was never monotonous or stale.  There was always
Pisah, the fish, to be caught in the many streams and the
little lakes, and Sabor, with her ferocious cousins to keep
one ever on the alert and give zest to every instant that one
spent upon the ground.
 
Often they hunted him, and more often he hunted them,
but though they never quite reached him with those cruel,
sharp claws of theirs, yet there were times when one could
scarce have passed a thick leaf between their talons and his
smooth hide.
 
Quick was Sabor, the lioness, and quick were Numa and
Sheeta, but Tarzan of the Apes was lightning.
 
With Tantor, the elephant, he made friends.  How?  Ask not.
But this is known to the denizens of the jungle, that on
many moonlight nights Tarzan of the Apes and Tantor, the
elephant, walked together, and where the way was clear Tarzan
rode, perched high upon Tantor's mighty back.
 
Many days during these years he spent in the cabin of his
father, where still lay, untouched, the bones of his parents
and the skeleton of Kala's baby.  At eighteen he read
fluently and understood nearly all he read in the many and
varied volumes on the shelves.
 
Also could he write, with printed letters, rapidly and plainly,
but script he had not mastered, for though there were several
copy books among his treasure, there was so little written
English in the cabin that he saw no use for bothering with this
other form of writing, though he could read it, laboriously.
 
Thus, at eighteen, we find him, an English lordling, who
could speak no English, and yet who could read and write his
native language.  Never had he seen a human being other
than himself, for the little area traversed by his tribe was
watered by no greater river to bring down the savage natives of
the interior.
 
High hills shut it off on three sides, the ocean on the
fourth.  It was alive with lions and leopards and poisonous
snakes.  Its untouched mazes of matted jungle had as yet
invited no hardy pioneer from the human beasts beyond its
frontier.
 
But as Tarzan of the Apes sat one day in the cabin of his
father delving into the mysteries of a new book, the ancient
security of his jungle was broken forever.
 
At the far eastern confine a strange cavalcade strung, in
single file, over the brow of a low hill.
 
In advance were fifty black warriors armed with slender
wooden spears with ends hard baked over slow fires, and long
bows and poisoned arrows.  On their backs were oval shields,
in their noses huge rings, while from the kinky wool of their
heads protruded tufts of gay feathers.
 
Across their foreheads were tattooed three parallel lines of
color, and on each breast three concentric circles.  Their
yellow teeth were filed to sharp points, and their great
protruding lips added still further to the low and bestial
brutishness of their appearance.
 
Following them were several hundred women and children,
the former bearing upon their heads great burdens of cooking
pots, household utensils and ivory.  In the rear were a
hundred warriors, similar in all respects to the advance guard.
 
That they more greatly feared an attack from the rear than
whatever unknown enemies lurked in their advance was
evidenced by the formation of the column; and such was the
fact, for they were fleeing from the white man's soldiers who
had so harassed them for rubber and ivory that they had
turned upon their conquerors one day and massacred a white
officer and a small detachment of his black troops.
 
For many days they had gorged themselves on meat, but
eventually a stronger body of troops had come and fallen upon
their village by night to revenge the death of their comrades.
 
That night the black soldiers of the white man had had
meat a-plenty, and this little remnant of a once powerful
tribe had slunk off into the gloomy jungle toward the
unknown, and freedom.
 
But that which meant freedom and the pursuit of happiness
to these savage blacks meant consternation and death to
many of the wild denizens of their new home.
 
For three days the little cavalcade marched slowly through
the heart of this unknown and untracked forest, until finally,
early in the fourth day, they came upon a little spot near the
banks of a small river, which seemed less thickly overgrown
than any ground they had yet encountered.
 
Here they set to work to build a new village, and in a
month a great clearing had been made, huts and palisades
erected, plantains, yams and maize planted, and they had
taken up their old life in their new home.  Here there were no
white men, no soldiers, nor any rubber or ivory to be gathered
for cruel and thankless taskmasters.
 
Several moons passed by ere the blacks ventured far into
the territory surrounding their new village.  Several had
already fallen prey to old Sabor, and because the jungle was so
infested with these fierce and bloodthirsty cats, and with lions
and leopards, the ebony warriors hesitated to trust themselves
far from the safety of their palisades.
 
But one day, Kulonga, a son of the old king, Mbonga,
wandered far into the dense mazes to the west.  Warily he
stepped, his slender lance ever ready, his long oval shield
firmly grasped in his left hand close to his sleek ebony body.
 
At his back his bow, and in the quiver upon his shield
many slim, straight arrows, well smeared with the thick, dark,
tarry substance that rendered deadly their tiniest needle prick.
 
Night found Kulonga far from the palisades of his father's
village, but still headed westward, and climbing into the fork
of a great tree he fashioned a rude platform and curled himself
for sleep.
 
Three miles to the west slept the tribe of Kerchak.
 
Early the next morning the apes were astir, moving
through the jungle in search of food.  Tarzan, as was his
custom, prosecuted his search in the direction of the cabin so
that by leisurely hunting on the way his stomach was filled by
the time he reached the beach.
 
The apes scattered by ones, and twos, and threes in all
directions, but ever within sound of a signal of alarm.
 
Kala had moved slowly along an elephant track toward the
east, and was busily engaged in turning over rotted limbs and
logs in search of succulent bugs and fungi, when the faintest
shadow of a strange noise brought her to startled attention.
 
For fifty yards before her the trail was straight, and down
this leafy tunnel she saw the stealthy advancing figure of a
strange and fearful creature.
 
It was Kulonga.
 
Kala did not wait to see more, but, turning, moved rapidly back
along the trail.  She did not run; but, after the manner of her
kind when not aroused, sought rather to avoid than to escape.
 
Close after her came Kulonga.  Here was meat.  He could
make a killing and feast well this day.  On he hurried, his
spear poised for the throw.
 
At a turning of the trail he came in sight of her again
upon another straight stretch.  His spear hand went far back
the muscles rolled, lightning-like, beneath the sleek hide.  Out
shot the arm, and the spear sped toward Kala.
 
A poor cast.  It but grazed her side.
 
With a cry of rage and pain the she-ape turned upon her
tormentor.  In an instant the trees were crashing beneath the
weight of her hurrying fellows, swinging rapidly toward the
scene of trouble in answer to Kala's scream.
 
As she charged, Kulonga unslung his bow and fitted an
arrow with almost unthinkable quickness.  Drawing the shaft
far back he drove the poisoned missile straight into the heart
of the great anthropoid.
 
With a horrid scream Kala plunged forward upon her face
before the astonished members of her tribe.
 
Roaring and shrieking the apes dashed toward Kulonga,
but that wary savage was fleeing down the trail like a
frightened antelope.
 
He knew something of the ferocity of these wild, hairy
men, and his one desire was to put as many miles between
himself and them as he possibly could.
 
They followed him, racing through the trees, for a long
distance, but finally one by one they abandoned the chase
and returned to the scene of the tragedy.
 
None of them had ever seen a man before, other than Tarzan,
and so they wondered vaguely what strange manner of
creature it might be that had invaded their jungle.
 
On the far beach by the little cabin Tarzan heard the faint
echoes of the conflict and knowing that something was
seriously amiss among the tribe he hastened rapidly toward the
direction of the sound.
 
When he arrived he found the entire tribe gathered jabbering
about the dead body of his slain mother.
 
Tarzan's grief and anger were unbounded.  He roared out
his hideous challenge time and again.  He beat upon his great
chest with his clenched fists, and then he fell upon the body
of Kala and sobbed out the pitiful sorrowing of his lonely heart.
 
To lose the only creature in all his world who ever had
manifested love and affection for him was the greatest
tragedy he had ever known.
 
What though Kala was a fierce and hideous ape!  To Tarzan
she had been kind, she had been beautiful.
 
Upon her he had lavished, unknown to himself, all the
reverence and respect and love that a normal English boy
feels for his own mother.  He had never known another, and
so to Kala was given, though mutely, all that would have
belonged to the fair and lovely Lady Alice had she lived.
 
After the first outburst of grief Tarzan controlled himself,
and questioning the members of the tribe who had witnessed
the killing of Kala he learned all that their meager vocabulary
could convey.
 
It was enough, however, for his needs.  It told him of a
strange, hairless, black ape with feathers growing upon its
head, who launched death from a slender branch, and then ran,
with the fleetness of Bara, the deer, toward the rising sun.
 
Tarzan waited no longer, but leaping into the branches of the
trees sped rapidly through the forest.  He knew the windings
of the elephant trail along which Kala's murderer had
flown, and so he cut straight through the jungle to intercept
the black warrior who was evidently following the tortuous
detours of the trail.
 
At his side was the hunting knife of his unknown sire, and
across his shoulders the coils of his own long rope.  In an
hour he struck the trail again, and coming to earth examined
the soil minutely.
 
In the soft mud on the bank of a tiny rivulet he found
footprints such as he alone in all the jungle had ever made,
but much larger than his.  His heart beat fast.  Could it be
that he was trailing a MAN--one of his own race?
 
There were two sets of imprints pointing in opposite directions.
So his quarry had already passed on his return along the
trail.  As he examined the newer spoor a tiny particle of
earth toppled from the outer edge of one of the footprints to
the bottom of its shallow depression--ah, the trail was very
fresh, his prey must have but scarcely passed.
 
Tarzan swung himself to the trees once more, and with
swift noiselessness sped along high above the trail.
 
He had covered barely a mile when he came upon the
black warrior standing in a little open space.  In his hand
was his slender bow to which he had fitted one of his death
dealing arrows.
 
Opposite him across the little clearing stood Horta, the
boar, with lowered head and foam flecked tucks, ready to
charge.
 
Tarzan looked with wonder upon the strange creature beneath
him--so like him in form and yet so different in face
and color.  His books had portrayed the NEGRO, but how
different had been the dull, dead print to this sleek thing of
ebony, pulsing with life.
 
As the man stood there with taut drawn bow Tarzan recognized him
not so much the NEGRO as the ARCHER of his picture book--
 
              A stands for Archer
 
 
How wonderful!  Tarzan almost betrayed his presence in
the deep excitement of his discovery.
 
But things were commencing to happen below him.  The sinewy
black arm had drawn the shaft far back; Horta, the
boar, was charging, and then the black released the little
poisoned arrow, and Tarzan saw it fly with the quickness of
thought and lodge in the bristling neck of the boar.
 
Scarcely had the shaft left his bow ere Kulonga had fitted
another to it, but Horta, the boar, was upon him so quickly
that he had no time to discharge it.  With a bound the black
leaped entirely over the rushing beast and turning with
incredible swiftness planted a second arrow in Horta's back.
 
Then Kulonga sprang into a near-by tree.
 
Horta wheeled to charge his enemy once more; a dozen steps
he took, then he staggered and fell upon his side.  For a
moment his muscles stiffened and relaxed convulsively, then
he lay still.
 
Kulonga came down from his tree.
 
With a knife that hung at his side he cut several large
pieces from the boar's body, and in the center of the trail he
built a fire, cooking and eating as much as he wanted.  The
rest he left where it had fallen.
 
Tarzan was an interested spectator.  His desire to kill
burned fiercely in his wild breast, but his desire to learn
was even greater.  He would follow this savage creature for a
while and know from whence he came.  He could kill him at
his leisure later, when the bow and deadly arrows were laid
aside.
 
When Kulonga had finished his repast and disappeared beyond
a near turning of the path, Tarzan dropped quietly to
the ground.  With his knife he severed many strips of meat
from Horta's carcass, but he did not cook them.
 
He had seen fire, but only when Ara, the lightning, had
destroyed some great tree.  That any creature of the jungle
could produce the red-and-yellow fangs which devoured
wood and left nothing but fine dust surprised Tarzan greatly,
and why the black warrior had ruined his delicious repast by
plunging it into the blighting heat was quite beyond him.
Possibly Ara was a friend with whom the Archer was sharing his food.
 
But, be that as it may, Tarzan would not ruin good meat in
any such foolish manner, so he gobbled down a great quantity
of the raw flesh, burying the balance of the carcass beside
the trail where he could find it upon his return.
 
And then Lord Greystoke wiped his greasy fingers upon
his naked thighs and took up the trail of Kulonga, the son of
Mbonga, the king; while in far-off London another Lord
Greystoke, the younger brother of the real Lord Greystoke's
father, sent back his chops to the club's CHEF because they
were underdone, and when he had finished his repast he
dipped his finger-ends into a silver bowl of scented water
and dried them upon a piece of snowy damask.
 
All day Tarzan followed Kulonga, hovering above him in
the trees like some malign spirit.  Twice more he saw him
hurl his arrows of destruction--once at Dango, the hyena,
and again at Manu, the monkey.  In each instance the animal
died almost instantly, for Kulonga's poison was very fresh
and very deadly.
 
Tarzan thought much on this wondrous method of slaying
as he swung slowly along at a safe distance behind his
quarry.  He knew that alone the tiny prick of the arrow could
not so quickly dispatch these wild things of the jungle, who
were often torn and scratched and gored in a frightful manner
as they fought with their jungle neighbors, yet as often
recovered as not.
 
No, there was something mysterious connected with these
tiny slivers of wood which could bring death by a mere
scratch.  He must look into the matter.
 
That night Kulonga slept in the crotch of a mighty tree
and far above him crouched Tarzan of the Apes.
 
When Kulonga awoke he found that his bow and arrows
had disappeared.  The black warrior was furious and
frightened, but more frightened than furious.  He searched
the ground below the tree, and he searched the tree above the
ground; but there was no sign of either bow or arrows or of
the nocturnal marauder.
 
Kulonga was panic-stricken.  His spear he had hurled at
Kala and had not recovered; and, now that his bow and arrows
were gone, he was defenseless except for a single knife.
His only hope lay in reaching the village of Mbonga as
quickly as his legs would carry him.
 
That he was not far from home he was certain, so he took
the trail at a rapid trot.
 
From a great mass of impenetrable foliage a few yards
away emerged Tarzan of the Apes to swing quietly in his wake.
 
Kulonga's bow and arrows were securely tied high in the
top of a giant tree from which a patch of bark had been
removed by a sharp knife near to the ground, and a branch
half cut through and left hanging about fifty feet higher up.
Thus Tarzan blazed the forest trails and marked his caches.
 
As Kulonga continued his journey Tarzan closed on him
until he traveled almost over the black's head.  His rope he
now held coiled in his right hand; he was almost ready for
the kill.
 
The moment was delayed only because Tarzan was anxious to
ascertain the black warrior's destination, and presently he
was rewarded, for they came suddenly in view of a great
clearing, at one end of which lay many strange lairs.
 
Tarzan was directly over Kulonga, as he made the discovery.
The forest ended abruptly and beyond lay two hundred
yards of planted fields between the jungle and the village.
 
Tarzan must act quickly or his prey would be gone; but
Tarzan's life training left so little space between decision and
action when an emergency confronted him that there was not
even room for the shadow of a thought between.
 
So it was that as Kulonga emerged from the shadow of the
jungle a slender coil of rope sped sinuously above him from
the lowest branch of a mighty tree directly upon the edge of
the fields of Mbonga, and ere the king's son had taken a half
dozen steps into the clearing a quick noose tightened about
his neck.
 
So quickly did Tarzan of the Apes drag back his prey that
Kulonga's cry of alarm was throttled in his windpipe.  Hand
over hand Tarzan drew the struggling black until he had him
hanging by his neck in mid-air; then Tarzan climbed to a
larger branch drawing the still threshing victim well up into
the sheltering verdure of the tree.
 
Here he fastened the rope securely to a stout branch, and
then, descending, plunged his hunting knife into Kulonga's
heart.  Kala was avenged.
 
Tarzan examined the black minutely, for he had never
seen any other human being.  The knife with its sheath and
belt caught his eye; he appropriated them.  A copper anklet
also took his fancy, and this he transferred to his own leg.
 
He examined and admired the tattooing on the forehead
and breast.  He marveled at the sharp filed teeth.
He investigated and appropriated the feathered headdress,
and then he prepared to get down to business, for Tarzan
of the Apes was hungry, and here was meat; meat of the kill,
which jungle ethics permitted him to eat.
 
How may we judge him, by what standards, this ape-man
with the heart and head and body of an English gentleman,
and the training of a wild beast?
 
Tublat, whom he had hated and who had hated him, he
had killed in a fair fight, and yet never had the thought of
eating Tublat's flesh entered his head.  It could have been as
revolting to him as is cannibalism to us.
 
But who was Kulonga that he might not be eaten as fairly
as Horta, the boar, or Bara, the deer?  Was he not simply
another of the countless wild things of the jungle who preyed
upon one another to satisfy the cravings of hunger?
 
Suddenly, a strange doubt stayed his hand.  Had not his
books taught him that he was a man?  And was not The
Archer a man, also?
 
Did men eat men?  Alas, he did not know.  Why, then, this
hesitancy!  Once more he essayed the effort, but a qualm of
nausea overwhelmed him.  He did not understand.
 
All he knew was that he could not eat the flesh of this
black man, and thus hereditary instinct, ages old, usurped the
functions of his untaught mind and saved him from transgressing
a worldwide law of whose very existence he was ignorant.
 
Quickly he lowered Kulonga's body to the ground, removed
the noose, and took to the trees again.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
From a lofty perch Tarzan viewed the village of thatched
huts across the intervening plantation.
 
He saw that at one point the forest touched the village, and
to this spot he made his way, lured by a fever of curiosity
to behold animals of his own kind, and to learn more of
their ways and view the strange lairs in which they lived.
 
His savage life among the fierce wild brutes of the jungle
left no opening for any thought that these could be aught else
than enemies.  Similarity of form led him into no erroneous
conception of the welcome that would be accorded him
should he be discovered by these, the first of his own kind he
had ever seen.
 
Tarzan of the Apes was no sentimentalist.  He knew nothing
of the brotherhood of man.  All things outside his own
tribe were his deadly enemies, with the few exceptions of
which Tantor, the elephant, was a marked example.
 
And he realized all this without malice or hatred.  To kill
was the law of the wild world he knew.  Few were his primitive
pleasures, but the greatest of these was to hunt and kill,
and so he accorded to others the right to cherish the same
desires as he, even though he himself might be the object of
their hunt.
 
His strange life had left him neither morose nor bloodthirsty.
That he joyed in killing, and that he killed with a joyous
laugh upon his handsome lips betokened no innate cruelty.
He killed for food most often, but, being a man, he sometimes
killed for pleasure, a thing which no other animal does;
for it has remained for man alone among all creatures to kill
senselessly and wantonly for the mere pleasure of inflicting
suffering and death.
 
And when he killed for revenge, or in self-defense, he did
that also without hysteria, for it was a very businesslike
proceeding which admitted of no levity.
 
So it was that now, as he cautiously approached the village of
Mbonga, he was quite prepared either to kill or be killed should
he be discovered.  He proceeded with unwonted stealth, for Kulonga
had taught him great respect for the little sharp splinters of
wood which dealt death so swiftly and unerringly.
 
At length he came to a great tree, heavy laden with thick
foliage and loaded with pendant loops of giant creepers.
From this almost impenetrable bower above the village he
crouched, looking down upon the scene below him, wondering
over every feature of this new, strange life.
 
There were naked children running and playing in the village
street.  There were women grinding dried plantain in
crude stone mortars, while others were fashioning cakes from
the powdered flour.  Out in the fields he could see still other
women hoeing, weeding, or gathering.
 
All wore strange protruding girdles of dried grass about
their hips and many were loaded with brass and copper
anklets, armlets and bracelets.  Around many a dusky neck hung
curiously coiled strands of wire, while several were further
ornamented by huge nose rings.
 
Tarzan of the Apes looked with growing wonder at these
strange creatures.  Dozing in the shade he saw several men,
while at the extreme outskirts of the clearing he occasionally
caught glimpses of armed warriors apparently guarding the
village against surprise from an attacking enemy.
 
He noticed that the women alone worked.  Nowhere was
there evidence of a man tilling the fields or performing
any of the homely duties of the village.
 
Finally his eyes rested upon a woman directly beneath him.
 
Before her was a small cauldron standing over a low fire
and in it bubbled a thick, reddish, tarry mass.  On one side of
her lay a quantity of wooden arrows the points of which she
dipped into the seething substance, then laying them upon a
narrow rack of boughs which stood upon her other side.
 
Tarzan of the Apes was fascinated.  Here was the secret of
the terrible destructiveness of The Archer's tiny missiles.
He noted the extreme care which the woman took that none of
the matter should touch her hands, and once when a particle
spattered upon one of her fingers he saw her plunge the
member into a vessel of water and quickly rub the tiny stain
away with a handful of leaves.
 
Tarzan knew nothing of poison, but his shrewd reasoning
told him that it was this deadly stuff that killed, and not the
little arrow, which was merely the messenger that carried it
into the body of its victim.
 
How he should like to have more of those little death-dealing
slivers.  If the woman would only leave her work for an
instant he could drop down, gather up a handful, and be
back in the tree again before she drew three breaths.
 
As he was trying to think out some plan to distract her
attention he heard a wild cry from across the clearing.  He
looked and saw a black warrior standing beneath the very
tree in which he had killed the murderer of Kala an hour before.
 
The fellow was shouting and waving his spear above his
head.  Now and again he would point to something on the
ground before him.
 
The village was in an uproar instantly.  Armed men rushed
from the interior of many a hut and raced madly across the
clearing toward the excited sentry.  After them trooped the
old men, and the women and children until, in a moment, the
village was deserted.
 
Tarzan of the Apes knew that they had found the body of
his victim, but that interested him far less than the fact that
no one remained in the village to prevent his taking a supply
of the arrows which lay below him.
 
Quickly and noiselessly he dropped to the ground beside
the cauldron of poison.  For a moment he stood motionless,
his quick, bright eyes scanning the interior of the palisade.
 
No one was in sight.  His eyes rested upon the open doorway
of a nearby hut.  He would take a look within, thought Tarzan,
and so, cautiously, he approached the low thatched building.
 
For a moment he stood without, listening intently.  There was
no sound, and he glided into the semi-darkness of the interior.
 
Weapons hung against the walls--long spears, strangely
shaped knives, a couple of narrow shields.  In the center of
the room was a cooking pot, and at the far end a litter of dry
grasses covered by woven mats which evidently served the
owners as beds and bedding.  Several human skulls lay upon
the floor.
 
Tarzan of the Apes felt of each article, hefted the spears,
smelled of them, for he "saw" largely through his sensitive
and highly trained nostrils.  He determined to own one of
these long, pointed sticks, but he could not take one on this
trip because of the arrows he meant to carry.
 
As he took each article from the walls, he placed it in a
pile in the center of the room.  On top of all he placed the
cooking pot, inverted, and on top of this he laid one of the
grinning skulls, upon which he fastened the headdress of the
dead Kulonga.
 
Then he stood back, surveyed his work, and grinned.
Tarzan of the Apes enjoyed a joke.
 
But now he heard, outside, the sounds of many voices, and
long mournful howls, and mighty wailing.  He was startled.
Had he remained too long?  Quickly he reached the doorway
and peered down the village street toward the village gate.
 
The natives were not yet in sight, though he could plainly
hear them approaching across the plantation.  They must be
very near.
 
Like a flash he sprang across the opening to the pile of arrows.
Gathering up all he could carry under one arm, he overturned
the seething cauldron with a kick, and disappeared into
the foliage above just as the first of the returning natives
entered the gate at the far end of the village street.  Then he
turned to watch the proceeding below, poised like some wild
bird ready to take swift wing at the first sign of danger.
 
The natives filed up the street, four of them bearing the
dead body of Kulonga.  Behind trailed the women, uttering
strange cries and weird lamentation.  On they came to the
portals of Kulonga's hut, the very one in which Tarzan had
wrought his depredations.
 
Scarcely had half a dozen entered the building ere they
came rushing out in wild, jabbering confusion.  The others
hastened to gather about.  There was much excited gesticulating,
pointing, and chattering; then several of the warriors
approached and peered within.
 
Finally an old fellow with many ornaments of metal about
his arms and legs, and a necklace of dried human hands
depending upon his chest, entered the hut.
 
It was Mbonga, the king, father of Kulonga.
 
For a few moments all was silent.  Then Mbonga emerged,
a look of mingled wrath and superstitious fear writ upon his
hideous countenance.  He spoke a few words to the assembled
warriors, and in an instant the men were flying through the
little village searching minutely every hut and corner within
the palisades.
 
Scarcely had the search commenced than the overturned
cauldron was discovered, and with it the theft of the poisoned
arrows.  Nothing more they found, and it was a thoroughly
awed and frightened group of savages which huddled around
their king a few moments later.
 
Mbonga could explain nothing of the strange events that
had taken place.  The finding of the still warm body of
Kulonga--on the very verge of their fields and within easy
earshot of the village--knifed and stripped at the door of
his father's home, was in itself sufficiently mysterious, but
these last awesome discoveries within the village, within the
dead Kulonga's own hut, filled their hearts with dismay, and
conjured in their poor brains only the most frightful of
superstitious explanations.
 
They stood in little groups, talking in low tones, and ever
casting affrighted glances behind them from their great
rolling eyes.
 
Tarzan of the Apes watched them for a while from his
lofty perch in the great tree.  There was much in their
demeanor which he could not understand, for of superstition
he was ignorant, and of fear of any kind he had but a vague
conception.
 
The sun was high in the heavens.  Tarzan had not broken
fast this day, and it was many miles to where lay the
toothsome remains of Horta the boar.
 
So he turned his back upon the village of Mbonga and
melted away into the leafy fastness of the forest.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
It was not yet dark when he reached the tribe, though he
stopped to exhume and devour the remains of the wild
boar he had cached the preceding day, and again to take
Kulonga's bow and arrows from the tree top in which he had
hidden them.
 
It was a well-laden Tarzan who dropped from the branches
into the midst of the tribe of Kerchak.
 
With swelling chest he narrated the glories of his adventure
and exhibited the spoils of conquest.
 
Kerchak grunted and turned away, for he was jealous of
this strange member of his band.  In his little evil brain he
sought for some excuse to wreak his hatred upon Tarzan.
 
The next day Tarzan was practicing with his bow and arrows
at the first gleam of dawn.  At first he lost nearly every
bolt he shot, but finally he learned to guide the little shafts
with fair accuracy, and ere a month had passed he was no
mean shot; but his proficiency had cost him nearly his entire
supply of arrows.
 
The tribe continued to find the hunting good in the vicinity
of the beach, and so Tarzan of the Apes varied his archery
practice with further investigation of his father's choice
though little store of books.
 
It was during this period that the young English lord found
hidden in the back of one of the cupboards in the cabin a
small metal box.  The key was in the lock, and a few moments
of investigation and experimentation were rewarded
with the successful opening of the receptacle.
 
In it he found a faded photograph of a smooth faced
young man, a golden locket studded with diamonds, linked to
a small gold chain, a few letters and a small book.
 
Tarzan examined these all minutely.
 
The photograph he liked most of all, for the eyes were
smiling, and the face was open and frank.  It was his father.
 
The locket, too, took his fancy, and he placed the chain
about his neck in imitation of the ornamentation he had seen
to be so common among the black men he had visited.  The
brilliant stones gleamed strangely against his smooth, brown hide.
 
The letters he could scarcely decipher for he had learned
little or nothing of script, so he put them back in the box
with the photograph and turned his attention to the book.
 
This was almost entirely filled with fine script, but while
the little bugs were all familiar to him, their arrangement and
the combinations in which they occurred were strange, and
entirely incomprehensible.
 
Tarzan had long since learned the use of the dictionary,
but much to his sorrow and perplexity it proved of no avail
to him in this emergency.  Not a word of all that was writ in
the book could he find, and so he put it back in the metal
box, but with a determination to work out the mysteries of it
later on.
 
Little did he know that this book held between its covers
the key to his origin--the answer to the strange riddle of
his strange life.  It was the diary of John Clayton, Lord
Greystoke--kept in French, as had always been his custom.
 
Tarzan replaced the box in the cupboard, but always thereafter
he carried the features of the strong, smiling face of his
father in his heart, and in his head a fixed determination to
solve the mystery of the strange words in the little black book.
 
At present he had more important business in hand, for his
supply of arrows was exhausted, and he must needs journey
to the black men's village and renew it.
 
Early the following morning he set out, and, traveling
rapidly, he came before midday to the clearing.  Once more he
took up his position in the great tree, and, as before, he saw
the women in the fields and the village street, and the cauldron
of bubbling poison directly beneath him.
 
For hours he lay awaiting his opportunity to drop down
unseen and gather up the arrows for which he had come; but
nothing now occurred to call the villagers away from their
homes.  The day wore on, and still Tarzan of the Apes
crouched above the unsuspecting woman at the cauldron.
 
Presently the workers in the fields returned.  The hunting
warriors emerged from the forest, and when all were within
the palisade the gates were closed and barred.
 
Many cooking pots were now in evidence about the village.
Before each hut a woman presided over a boiling stew, while
little cakes of plantain, and cassava puddings were to be seen
on every hand.
 
Suddenly there came a hail from the edge of the clearing.
 
Tarzan looked.
 
It was a party of belated hunters returning from the north,
and among them they half led, half carried a struggling animal.
 
As they approached the village the gates were thrown open
to admit them, and then, as the people saw the victim of the
chase, a savage cry rose to the heavens, for the quarry was a man.
 
As he was dragged, still resisting, into the village street, the
women and children set upon him with sticks and stones, and
Tarzan of the Apes, young and savage beast of the jungle,
wondered at the cruel brutality of his own kind.
 
Sheeta, the leopard, alone of all the jungle folk, tortured
his prey.  The ethics of all the others meted a quick and
merciful death to their victims.
 
Tarzan had learned from his books but scattered fragments
of the ways of human beings.
 
When he had followed Kulonga through the forest he had
expected to come to a city of strange houses on wheels,
puffing clouds of black smoke from a huge tree stuck in the
roof of one of them--or to a sea covered with mighty floating
buildings which he had learned were called, variously, ships
and boats and steamers and craft.
 
He had been sorely disappointed with the poor little village
of the blacks, hidden away in his own jungle, and with not a
single house as large as his own cabin upon the distant beach.
 
He saw that these people were more wicked than his own apes,
and as savage and cruel as Sabor, herself.  Tarzan began
to hold his own kind in low esteem.
 
Now they had tied their poor victim to a great post near
the center of the village, directly before Mbonga's hut, and
here they formed a dancing, yelling circle of warriors about
him, alive with flashing knives and menacing spears.
 
In a larger circle squatted the women, yelling and beating
upon drums.  It reminded Tarzan of the Dum-Dum, and so he
knew what to expect.  He wondered if they would spring upon
their meat while it was still alive.  The Apes did not do such
things as that.
 
The circle of warriors about the cringing captive drew closer
and closer to their prey as they danced in wild and savage
abandon to the maddening music of the drums.  Presently
a spear reached out and pricked the victim.  It was the signal
for fifty others.
 
Eyes, ears, arms and legs were pierced; every inch of the
poor writhing body that did not cover a vital organ became
the target of the cruel lancers.
 
The women and children shrieked their delight.
 
The warriors licked their hideous lips in anticipation of the
feast to come, and vied with one another in the savagery and
loathsomeness of the cruel indignities with which they tortured
the still conscious prisoner.
 
Then it was that Tarzan of the Apes saw his chance.  All eyes
were fixed upon the thrilling spectacle at the stake.  The
light of day had given place to the darkness of a moonless night,
and only the fires in the immediate vicinity of the orgy had
been kept alight to cast a restless glow upon the restless scene.
 
Gently the lithe boy dropped to the soft earth at the end of
the village street.  Quickly he gathered up the arrows--all of
them this time, for he had brought a number of long fibers to
bind them into a bundle.
 
Without haste he wrapped them securely, and then, ere he
turned to leave, the devil of capriciousness entered his heart.
He looked about for some hint of a wild prank to play upon
these strange, grotesque creatures that they might be again
aware of his presence among them.
 
Dropping his bundle of arrows at the foot of the tree, Tarzan
crept among the shadows at the side of the street until he
came to the same hut he had entered on the occasion of his
first visit.
 
Inside all was darkness, but his groping hands soon found
the object for which he sought, and without further delay he
turned again toward the door.
 
He had taken but a step, however, ere his quick ear caught
the sound of approaching footsteps immediately without.  In
another instant the figure of a woman darkened the entrance
of the hut.
 
Tarzan drew back silently to the far wall, and his hand
sought the long, keen hunting knife of his father.  The woman
came quickly to the center of the hut.  There she paused for
an instant feeling about with her hands for the thing she
sought.  Evidently it was not in its accustomed place, for she
explored ever nearer and nearer the wall where Tarzan stood.
 
So close was she now that the ape-man felt the animal
warmth of her naked body.  Up went the hunting knife, and
then the woman turned to one side and soon a guttural "ah"
proclaimed that her search had at last been successful.
 
Immediately she turned and left the hut, and as she passed
through the doorway Tarzan saw that she carried a cooking
pot in her hand.
 
He followed closely after her, and as he reconnoitered
from the shadows of the doorway he saw that all the women
of the village were hastening to and from the various huts
with pots and kettles.  These they were filling with water and
placing over a number of fires near the stake where the dying
victim now hung, an inert and bloody mass of suffering.
 
Choosing a moment when none seemed near, Tarzan hastened
to his bundle of arrows beneath the great tree at
the end of the village street.  As on the former occasion he
overthrew the cauldron before leaping, sinuous and catlike,
into the lower branches of the forest giant.
 
Silently he climbed to a great height until he found a point
where he could look through a leafy opening upon the scene
beneath him.
 
The women were now preparing the prisoner for their cooking
pots, while the men stood about resting after the fatigue of
their mad revel.  Comparative quiet reigned in the village.
 
Tarzan raised aloft the thing he had pilfered from the hut,
and, with aim made true by years of fruit and coconut throwing,
launched it toward the group of savages.
 
Squarely among them it fell, striking one of the warriors
full upon the head and felling him to the ground.  Then it
rolled among the women and stopped beside the half-butchered
thing they were preparing to feast upon.
 
All gazed in consternation at it for an instant, and then,
with one accord, broke and ran for their huts.
 
It was a grinning human skull which looked up at them from
the ground.  The dropping of the thing out of the open sky
was a miracle well aimed to work upon their superstitious fears.
 
Thus Tarzan of the Apes left them filled with terror at this
new manifestation of the presence of some unseen and unearthly
evil power which lurked in the forest about their village.
 
Later, when they discovered the overturned cauldron, and
that once more their arrows had been pilfered, it commenced
to dawn upon them that they had offended some great god by
placing their village in this part of the jungle without
propitiating him.  From then on an offering of food was daily
placed below the great tree from whence the arrows had
disappeared in an effort to conciliate the mighty one.
 
But the seed of fear was deep sown, and had he but known
it, Tarzan of the Apes had laid the foundation for much
future misery for himself and his tribe.
 
That night he slept in the forest not far from the village,
and early the next morning set out slowly on his homeward
march, hunting as he traveled.  Only a few berries and an
occasional grub worm rewarded his search, and he was half
famished when, looking up from a log he had been rooting
beneath, he saw Sabor, the lioness, standing in the center
of the trail not twenty paces from him.
 
The great yellow eyes were fixed upon him with a wicked
and baleful gleam, and the red tongue licked the longing lips
as Sabor crouched, worming her stealthy way with belly
flattened against the earth.
 
Tarzan did not attempt to escape.  He welcomed the
opportunity for which, in fact, he had been searching for
days past, now that he was armed with something more than a
rope of grass.
 
Quickly he unslung his bow and fitted a well-daubed arrow,
and as Sabor sprang, the tiny missile leaped to meet her
in mid-air.  At the same instant Tarzan of the Apes jumped
to one side, and as the great cat struck the ground beyond
him another death-tipped arrow sunk deep into Sabor's loin.
 
With a mighty roar the beast turned and charged once
more, only to be met with a third arrow full in one eye; but
this time she was too close to the ape-man for the latter to
sidestep the onrushing body.
 
Tarzan of the Apes went down beneath the great body of
his enemy, but with gleaming knife drawn and striking home.
For a moment they lay there, and then Tarzan realized that
the inert mass lying upon him was beyond power ever again
to injure man or ape.
 
With difficulty he wriggled from beneath the great weight,
and as he stood erect and gazed down upon the trophy of his
skill, a mighty wave of exultation swept over him.
 
With swelling breast, he placed a foot upon the body of his
powerful enemy, and throwing back his fine young head,
roared out the awful challenge of the victorious bull ape.
 
The forest echoed to the savage and triumphant paean.
Birds fell still, and the larger animals and beasts of prey
slunk stealthily away, for few there were of all the jungle
who sought for trouble with the great anthropoids.
 
And in London another Lord Greystoke was speaking to
HIS kind in the House of Lords, but none trembled at the
sound of his soft voice.
 
Sabor proved unsavory eating even to Tarzan of the Apes,
but hunger served as a most efficacious disguise to toughness
and rank taste, and ere long, with well-filled stomach, the
ape-man was ready to sleep again.  First, however, he must
remove the hide, for it was as much for this as for any other
purpose that he had desired to destroy Sabor.
 
Deftly he removed the great pelt, for he had practiced
often on smaller animals.  When the task was finished he
carried his trophy to the fork of a high tree, and there,
curling himself securely in a crotch, he fell into deep and
dreamless slumber.
 
What with loss of sleep, arduous exercise, and a full belly,
Tarzan of the Apes slept the sun around, awakening about
noon of the following day.  He straightway repaired to the
carcass of Sabor, but was angered to find the bones picked
clean by other hungry denizens of the jungle.
 
Half an hour's leisurely progress through the forest
brought to sight a young deer, and before the little creature
knew that an enemy was near a tiny arrow had lodged in its neck.
 
So quickly the virus worked that at the end of a dozen
leaps the deer plunged headlong into the undergrowth, dead.
Again did Tarzan feast well, but this time he did not sleep.
 
Instead, he hastened on toward the point where he had left
the tribe, and when he had found them proudly exhibited the
skin of Sabor, the lioness.
 
"Look!" he cried, "Apes of Kerchak.  See what Tarzan, the
mighty killer, has done.  Who else among you has ever killed
one of Numa's people?  Tarzan is mightiest amongst you for
Tarzan is no ape.  Tarzan is--"  But here he stopped, for in the
language of the anthropoids there was no word for man, and
Tarzan could only write the word in English; he could not
pronounce it.
 
The tribe had gathered about to look upon the proof of his
wondrous prowess, and to listen to his words.
 
Only Kerchak hung back, nursing his hatred and his rage.
 
Suddenly something snapped in the wicked little brain of
the anthropoid.  With a frightful roar the great beast sprang
among the assemblage.
 
Biting, and striking with his huge hands, he killed and
maimed a dozen ere the balance could escape to the upper
terraces of the forest.
 
Frothing and shrieking in the insanity of his fury, Kerchak
looked about for the object of his greatest hatred, and there,
upon a near-by limb, he saw him sitting.
 
"Come down, Tarzan, great killer," cried Kerchak.  "Come
down and feel the fangs of a greater!  Do mighty fighters fly
to the trees at the first approach of danger?"  And then Kerchak
emitted the volleying challenge of his kind.
 
Quietly Tarzan dropped to the ground.  Breathlessly the
tribe watched from their lofty perches as Kerchak, still
roaring, charged the relatively puny figure.
 
Nearly seven feet stood Kerchak on his short legs.  His
enormous shoulders were bunched and rounded with huge
muscles.  The back of his short neck was as a single lump of
iron sinew which bulged beyond the base of his skull, so that
his head seemed like a small ball protruding from a huge
mountain of flesh.
 
His back-drawn, snarling lips exposed his great fighting
fangs, and his little, wicked, blood-shot eyes gleamed in
horrid reflection of his madness.
 
Awaiting him stood Tarzan, himself a mighty muscled animal,
but his six feet of height and his great rolling sinews
seemed pitifully inadequate to the ordeal which awaited them.
 
His bow and arrows lay some distance away where he had
dropped them while showing Sabor's hide to his fellow apes,
so that he confronted Kerchak now with only his hunting
knife and his superior intellect to offset the ferocious
strength of his enemy.
 
As his antagonist came roaring toward him, Lord Greystoke
tore his long knife from its sheath, and with an answering
challenge as horrid and bloodcurdling as that of the beast
he faced, rushed swiftly to meet the attack.  He was too
shrewd to allow those long hairy arms to encircle him, and
just as their bodies were about to crash together, Tarzan of
the Apes grasped one of the huge wrists of his assailant, and,
springing lightly to one side, drove his knife to the hilt into
Kerchak's body, below the heart.
 
Before he could wrench the blade free again, the bull's
quick lunge to seize him in those awful arms had torn the
weapon from Tarzan's grasp.
 
Kerchak aimed a terrific blow at the ape-man's head with the
flat of his hand, a blow which, had it landed, might easily
have crushed in the side of Tarzan's skull.
 
The man was too quick, and, ducking beneath it, himself
delivered a mighty one, with clenched fist, in the pit of
Kerchak's stomach.
 
The ape was staggered, and what with the mortal wound in
his side had almost collapsed, when, with one mighty effort
he rallied for an instant--just long enough to enable him to
wrest his arm free from Tarzan's grasp and close in a terrific
clinch with his wiry opponent.
 
Straining the ape-man close to him, his great jaws sought
Tarzan's throat, but the young lord's sinewy fingers were at
Kerchak's own before the cruel fangs could close on the sleek
brown skin.
 
Thus they struggled, the one to crush out his opponent's
life with those awful teeth, the other to close forever the
windpipe beneath his strong grasp while he held the snarling
mouth from him.
 
The greater strength of the ape was slowly prevailing, and
the teeth of the straining beast were scarce an inch from
Tarzan's throat when, with a shuddering tremor, the great body
stiffened for an instant and then sank limply to the ground.
 
Kerchak was dead.
 
Withdrawing the knife that had so often rendered him
master of far mightier muscles than his own, Tarzan of the
Apes placed his foot upon the neck of his vanquished enemy,
and once again, loud through the forest rang the fierce, wild
cry of the conqueror.
 
And thus came the young Lord Greystoke into the kingship of the Apes.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
There was one of the tribe of Tarzan who questioned his
authority, and that was Terkoz, the son of Tublat, but he
so feared the keen knife and the deadly arrows of his new
lord that he confined the manifestation of his objections to
petty disobediences and irritating mannerisms; Tarzan knew,
however, that he but waited his opportunity to wrest the
kingship from him by some sudden stroke of treachery, and
so he was ever on his guard against surprise.
 
For months the life of the little band went on much as it
had before, except that Tarzan's greater intelligence and his
ability as a hunter were the means of providing for them
more bountifully than ever before.  Most of them, therefore,
were more than content with the change in rulers.
 
Tarzan led them by night to the fields of the black men,
and there, warned by their chief's superior wisdom, they ate
only what they required, nor ever did they destroy what they
could not eat, as is the way of Manu, the monkey, and of
most apes.
 
So, while the blacks were wroth at the continued pilfering
of their fields, they were not discouraged in their efforts to
cultivate the land, as would have been the case had Tarzan
permitted his people to lay waste the plantation wantonly.
 
During this period Tarzan paid many nocturnal visits to the
village, where he often renewed his supply of arrows.  He
soon noticed the food always standing at the foot of the tree
which was his avenue into the palisade, and after a little, he
commenced to eat whatever the blacks put there.
 
When the awe-struck savages saw that the food disappeared
overnight they were filled with consternation and dread,
for it was one thing to put food out to propitiate a god
or a devil, but quite another thing to have the spirit really
come into the village and eat it.  Such a thing was unheard of,
and it clouded their superstitious minds with all manner of
vague fears.
 
Nor was this all.  The periodic disappearance of their
arrows, and the strange pranks perpetrated by unseen hands,
had wrought them to such a state that life had become a
veritable burden in their new home, and now it was that Mbonga
and his head men began to talk of abandoning the village and
seeking a site farther on in the jungle.
 
Presently the black warriors began to strike farther and
farther south into the heart of the forest when they went to
hunt, looking for a site for a new village.
 
More often was the tribe of Tarzan disturbed by these
wandering huntsmen.  Now was the quiet, fierce solitude of
the primeval forest broken by new, strange cries.  No longer
was there safety for bird or beast.  Man had come.
 
Other animals passed up and down the jungle by day and
by night--fierce, cruel beasts--but their weaker neighbors
only fled from their immediate vicinity to return again when
the danger was past.
 
With man it is different.  When he comes many of the larger
animals instinctively leave the district entirely, seldom
if ever to return; and thus it has always been with the great
anthropoids.  They flee man as man flees a pestilence.
 
For a short time the tribe of Tarzan lingered in the vicinity
of the beach because their new chief hated the thought of
leaving the treasured contents of the little cabin forever.  But
when one day a member of the tribe discovered the blacks in
great numbers on the banks of a little stream that had been
their watering place for generations, and in the act of clearing
a space in the jungle and erecting many huts, the apes would
remain no longer; and so Tarzan led them inland for many
marches to a spot as yet undefiled by the foot of a human being.
 
Once every moon Tarzan would go swinging rapidly back
through the swaying branches to have a day with his books,
and to replenish his supply of arrows.  This latter task was
becoming more and more difficult, for the blacks had taken to
hiding their supply away at night in granaries and living huts.
 
This necessitated watching by day on Tarzan's part to
discover where the arrows were being concealed.
 
Twice had he entered huts at night while the inmates lay
sleeping upon their mats, and stolen the arrows from the very
sides of the warriors.  But this method he realized to be too
fraught with danger, and so he commenced picking up solitary
hunters with his long, deadly noose, stripping them of weapons
and ornaments and dropping their bodies from a high tree into
the village street during the still watches of the night.
 
These various escapades again so terrorized the blacks that,
had it not been for the monthly respite between Tarzan's
visits, in which they had opportunity to renew hope that each
fresh incursion would prove the last, they soon would have
abandoned their new village.
 
The blacks had not as yet come upon Tarzan's cabin on
the distant beach, but the ape-man lived in constant dread
that, while he was away with the tribe, they would discover
and despoil his treasure.  So it came that he spent more and
more time in the vicinity of his father's last home, and less
and less with the tribe.  Presently the members of his little
community began to suffer on account of his neglect, for
disputes and quarrels constantly arose which only the king
might settle peaceably.
 
At last some of the older apes spoke to Tarzan on the subject,
and for a month thereafter he remained constantly with
the tribe.
 
The duties of kingship among the anthropoids are not
many or arduous.
 
In the afternoon comes Thaka, possibly, to complain that
old Mungo has stolen his new wife.  Then must Tarzan summon
all before him, and if he finds that the wife prefers her
new lord he commands that matters remain as they are, or
possibly that Mungo give Thaka one of his daughters in exchange.
 
Whatever his decision, the apes accept it as final, and
return to their occupations satisfied.
 
Then comes Tana, shrieking and holding tight her side
from which blood is streaming.  Gunto, her husband, has
cruelly bitten her!  And Gunto, summoned, says that Tana is
lazy and will not bring him nuts and beetles, or scratch his
back for him.
 
So Tarzan scolds them both and threatens Gunto with a
taste of the death-bearing slivers if he abuses Tana further,
and Tana, for her part, is compelled to promise better
attention to her wifely duties.
 
And so it goes, little family differences for the most part,
which, if left unsettled would result finally in greater
factional strife, and the eventual dismemberment of the tribe.
 
But Tarzan tired of it, as he found that kingship meant the
curtailment of his liberty.  He longed for the little cabin and
the sun-kissed sea--for the cool interior of the well-built
house, and for the never-ending wonders of the many books.
 
As he had grown older, he found that he had grown away
from his people.  Their interests and his were far removed.
They had not kept pace with him, nor could they understand
aught of the many strange and wonderful dreams that passed
through the active brain of their human king.  So limited was
their vocabulary that Tarzan could not even talk with them
of the many new truths, and the great fields of thought that
his reading had opened up before his longing eyes, or make
known ambitions which stirred his soul.
 
Among the tribe he no longer had friends as of old.  A little
child may find companionship in many strange and simple
creatures, but to a grown man there must be some semblance
of equality in intellect as the basis for agreeable association.
 
Had Kala lived, Tarzan would have sacrificed all else to
remain near her, but now that she was dead, and the playful
friends of his childhood grown into fierce and surly brutes he
felt that he much preferred the peace and solitude of his
cabin to the irksome duties of leadership amongst a horde of
wild beasts.
 
The hatred and jealousy of Terkoz, son of Tublat, did
much to counteract the effect of Tarzan's desire to renounce
his kingship among the apes, for, stubborn young Englishman
that he was, he could not bring himself to retreat in the face
of so malignant an enemy.
 
That Terkoz would be chosen leader in his stead he knew
full well, for time and again the ferocious brute had
established his claim to physical supremacy over the
few bull apes who had dared resent his savage bullying.
 
Tarzan would have liked to subdue the ugly beast without
recourse to knife or arrows.  So much had his great strength
and agility increased in the period following his maturity that
he had come to believe that he might master the redoubtable
Terkoz in a hand to hand fight were it not for the terrible
advantage the anthropoid's huge fighting fangs gave him
over the poorly armed Tarzan.
 
The entire matter was taken out of Tarzan's hands one day
by force of circumstances, and his future left open to him, so
that he might go or stay without any stain upon his savage
escutcheon.
 
It happened thus:
 
The tribe was feeding quietly, spread over a considerable
area, when a great screaming arose some distance east of
where Tarzan lay upon his belly beside a limpid brook,
attempting to catch an elusive fish in his quick, brown hands.
 
With one accord the tribe swung rapidly toward the frightened
cries, and there found Terkoz holding an old female by
the hair and beating her unmercifully with his great hands.
 
As Tarzan approached he raised his hand aloft for Terkoz
to desist, for the female was not his, but belonged to a poor
old ape whose fighting days were long over, and who, therefore,
could not protect his family.
 
Terkoz knew that it was against the laws of his kind to
strike this woman of another, but being a bully, he had taken
advantage of the weakness of the female's husband to chastise
her because she had refused to give up to him a tender
young rodent she had captured.
 
When Terkoz saw Tarzan approaching without his arrows,
he continued to belabor the poor woman in a studied effort to
affront his hated chieftain.
 
Tarzan did not repeat his warning signal, but instead
rushed bodily upon the waiting Terkoz.
 
Never had the ape-man fought so terrible a battle since
that long-gone day when Bolgani, the great king gorilla had
so horribly manhandled him ere the new-found knife had, by
accident, pricked the savage heart.
 
Tarzan's knife on the present occasion but barely offset the
gleaming fangs of Terkoz, and what little advantage the ape
had over the man in brute strength was almost balanced by
the latter's wonderful quickness and agility.
 
In the sum total of their points, however, the anthropoid
had a shade the better of the battle, and had there been no
other personal attribute to influence the final outcome,
Tarzan of the Apes, the young Lord Greystoke, would have died
as he had lived--an unknown savage beast in equatorial Africa.
 
But there was that which had raised him far above his fellows
of the jungle--that little spark which spells the whole
vast difference between man and brute--Reason.  This it was
which saved him from death beneath the iron muscles and
tearing fangs of Terkoz.
 
Scarcely had they fought a dozen seconds ere they were
rolling upon the ground, striking, tearing and rending--two
great savage beasts battling to the death.
 
Terkoz had a dozen knife wounds on head and breast, and
Tarzan was torn and bleeding--his scalp in one place half
torn from his head so that a great piece hung down over one
eye, obstructing his vision.
 
But so far the young Englishman had been able to keep
those horrible fangs from his jugular and now, as they fought
less fiercely for a moment, to regain their breath, Tarzan
formed a cunning plan.  He would work his way to the other's
back and, clinging there with tooth and nail, drive his knife
home until Terkoz was no more.
 
The maneuver was accomplished more easily than he had
hoped, for the stupid beast, not knowing what Tarzan was
attempting, made no particular effort to prevent the
accomplishment of the design.
 
But when, finally, he realized that his antagonist was
fastened to him where his teeth and fists alike were useless
against him, Terkoz hurled himself about upon the ground so
violently that Tarzan could but cling desperately to the
leaping, turning, twisting body, and ere he had struck a
blow the knife was hurled from his hand by a heavy impact
against the earth, and Tarzan found himself defenseless.
 
During the rollings and squirmings of the next few minutes,
Tarzan's hold was loosened a dozen times until finally
an accidental circumstance of those swift and everchanging
evolutions gave him a new hold with his right hand, which he
realized was absolutely unassailable.
 
His arm was passed beneath Terkoz's arm from behind
and his hand and forearm encircled the back of Terkoz's
neck.  It was the half-Nelson of modern wrestling which the
untaught ape-man had stumbled upon, but superior reason
showed him in an instant the value of the thing he had
discovered.  It was the difference to him between life and death.
 
And so he struggled to encompass a similar hold with the
left hand, and in a few moments Terkoz's bull neck was
creaking beneath a full-Nelson.
 
There was no more lunging about now.  The two lay perfectly
still upon the ground, Tarzan upon Terkoz's back.  Slowly the
bullet head of the ape was being forced lower and
lower upon his chest.
 
Tarzan knew what the result would be.  In an instant the
neck would break.  Then there came to Terkoz's rescue the
same thing that had put him in these sore straits--a man's
reasoning power.
 
"If I kill him," thought Tarzan, "what advantage will it be
to me?  Will it not rob the tribe of a great fighter?  And if
Terkoz be dead, he will know nothing of my supremacy,
while alive he will ever be an example to the other apes."
 
"KA-GODA?" hissed Tarzan in Terkoz's ear, which, in ape
tongue, means, freely translated:  "Do you surrender?"
 
For a moment there was no reply, and Tarzan added a few
more ounces of pressure, which elicited a horrified shriek
of pain from the great beast.
 
"KA-GODA?" repeated Tarzan.
 
"KA-GODA!" cried Terkoz.
 
"Listen," said Tarzan, easing up a trifle, but not releasing
his hold.  "I am Tarzan, King of the Apes, mighty hunter,
mighty fighter.  In all the jungle there is none so great.
 
"You have said:  `KA-GODA' to me.  All the tribe have heard.
Quarrel no more with your king or your people, for next
time I shall kill you.  Do you understand?"
 
"HUH," assented Terkoz.
 
"And you are satisfied?"
 
"HUH," said the ape.
 
Tarzan let him up, and in a few minutes all were back at
their vocations, as though naught had occurred to mar the
tranquility of their primeval forest haunts.
 
But deep in the minds of the apes was rooted the conviction
that Tarzan was a mighty fighter and a strange creature.
Strange because he had had it in his power to kill his enemy,
but had allowed him to live--unharmed.
 
That afternoon as the tribe came together, as was their
wont before darkness settled on the jungle, Tarzan, his
wounds washed in the waters of the stream, called the old
males about him.
 
"You have seen again to-day that Tarzan of the Apes is
the greatest among you," he said.
 
"HUH," they replied with one voice, "Tarzan is great."
 
"Tarzan," he continued, "is not an ape.  He is not like his
people.  His ways are not their ways, and so Tarzan is going
back to the lair of his own kind by the waters of the great
lake which has no farther shore.  You must choose another to
rule you, for Tarzan will not return."
 
And thus young Lord Greystoke took the first step toward
the goal which he had set--the finding of other white men
like himself.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
The following morning, Tarzan, lame and sore from the
wounds of his battle with Terkoz, set out toward the west
and the seacoast.
 
He traveled very slowly, sleeping in the jungle at night,
and reaching his cabin late the following morning.
 
For several days he moved about but little, only enough to
gather what fruits and nuts he required to satisfy the demands
of hunger.
 
In ten days he was quite sound again, except for a terrible,
half-healed scar, which, starting above his left eye ran across
the top of his head, ending at the right ear.  It was the mark
left by Terkoz when he had torn the scalp away.
 
During his convalescence Tarzan tried to fashion a mantle
from the skin of Sabor, which had lain all this time in the
cabin.  But he found the hide had dried as stiff as a board,
and as he knew naught of tanning, he was forced to abandon
his cherished plan.
 
Then he determined to filch what few garments he could
from one of the black men of Mbonga's village, for Tarzan
of the Apes had decided to mark his evolution from the
lower orders in every possible manner, and nothing seemed to
him a more distinguishing badge of manhood than ornaments
and clothing.
 
To this end, therefore, he collected the various arm and leg
ornaments he had taken from the black warriors who had
succumbed to his swift and silent noose, and donned them all
after the way he had seen them worn.
 
About his neck hung the golden chain from which depended
the diamond encrusted locket of his mother, the Lady
Alice.  At his back was a quiver of arrows slung from a
leathern shoulder belt, another piece of loot from some
vanquished black.
 
About his waist was a belt of tiny strips of rawhide
fashioned by himself as a support for the home-made scabbard in
which hung his father's hunting knife.  The long bow which
had been Kulonga's hung over his left shoulder.
 
The young Lord Greystoke was indeed a strange and war-like
figure, his mass of black hair falling to his shoulders
behind and cut with his hunting knife to a rude bang upon
his forehead, that it might not fall before his eyes.
 
His straight and perfect figure, muscled as the best of the
ancient Roman gladiators must have been muscled, and yet
with the soft and sinuous curves of a Greek god, told at a
glance the wondrous combination of enormous strength with
suppleness and speed.
 
A personification, was Tarzan of the Apes, of the primitive
man, the hunter, the warrior.
 
With the noble poise of his handsome head upon those broad
shoulders, and the fire of life and intelligence in those
fine, clear eyes, he might readily have typified some demigod
of a wild and warlike bygone people of his ancient forest.
 
But of these things Tarzan did not think.  He was worried
because he had not clothing to indicate to all the jungle folks
that he was a man and not an ape, and grave doubt often
entered his mind as to whether he might not yet become an ape.
 
Was not hair commencing to grow upon his face?  All the
apes had hair upon theirs but the black men were entirely
hairless, with very few exceptions.
 
True, he had seen pictures in his books of men with great
masses of hair upon lip and cheek and chin, but, nevertheless,
Tarzan was afraid.  Almost daily he whetted his keen knife
and scraped and whittled at his young beard to eradicate this
degrading emblem of apehood.
 
And so he learned to shave--rudely and painfully, it is
true--but, nevertheless, effectively.
 
When he felt quite strong again, after his bloody battle
with Terkoz, Tarzan set off one morning towards Mbonga's
village.  He was moving carelessly along a winding jungle
trail, instead of making his progress through the trees, when
suddenly he came face to face with a black warrior.
 
The look of surprise on the savage face was almost comical,
and before Tarzan could unsling his bow the fellow had
turned and fled down the path crying out in alarm as though
to others before him.
 
Tarzan took to the trees in pursuit, and in a few moments
came in view of the men desperately striving to escape.
 
There were three of them, and they were racing madly in
single file through the dense undergrowth.
 
Tarzan easily distanced them, nor did they see his silent
passage above their heads, nor note the crouching figure
squatted upon a low branch ahead of them beneath which the
trail led them.
 
Tarzan let the first two pass beneath him, but as the third
came swiftly on, the quiet noose dropped about the black
throat.  A quick jerk drew it taut.
 
There was an agonized scream from the victim, and his
fellows turned to see his struggling body rise as by magic
slowly into the dense foliage of the trees above.
 
With frightened shrieks they wheeled once more and plunged
on in their efforts to escape.
 
Tarzan dispatched his prisoner quickly and silently; removed
the weapons and ornaments, and--oh, the greatest joy
of all--a handsome deerskin breechcloth, which he quickly
transferred to his own person.
 
Now indeed was he dressed as a man should be.  None
there was who could now doubt his high origin.  How he
should have liked to have returned to the tribe to parade
before their envious gaze this wondrous finery.
 
Taking the body across his shoulder, he moved more
slowly through the trees toward the little palisaded village,
for he again needed arrows.
 
As he approached quite close to the enclosure he saw an
excited group surrounding the two fugitives, who, trembling
with fright and exhaustion, were scarce able to recount the
uncanny details of their adventure.
 
Mirando, they said, who had been ahead of them a short
distance, had suddenly come screaming toward them, crying
that a terrible white and naked warrior was pursuing him.
The three of them had hurried toward the village as rapidly
as their legs would carry them.
 
Again Mirando's shrill cry of mortal terror had caused
them to look back, and there they had seen the most horrible
sight--their companion's body flying upwards into the trees,
his arms and legs beating the air and his tongue protruding
from his open mouth.  No other sound did he utter nor was
there any creature in sight about him.
 
The villagers were worked up into a state of fear bordering
on panic, but wise old Mbonga affected to feel considerable
skepticism regarding the tale, and attributed the whole
fabrication to their fright in the face of some real danger.
 
"You tell us this great story," he said, "because you do not
dare to speak the truth.  You do not dare admit that when the
lion sprang upon Mirando you ran away and left him.  You
are cowards."
 
Scarcely had Mbonga ceased speaking when a great crashing
of branches in the trees above them caused the blacks to
look up in renewed terror.  The sight that met their eyes made
even wise old Mbonga shudder, for there, turning and twisting
in the air, came the dead body of Mirando, to sprawl with a
sickening reverberation upon the ground at their feet.
 
With one accord the blacks took to their heels; nor did
they stop until the last of them was lost in the dense
shadows of the surrounding jungle.
 
Again Tarzan came down into the village and renewed his
supply of arrows and ate of the offering of food which the
blacks had made to appease his wrath.
 
Before he left he carried the body of Mirando to the gate
of the village, and propped it up against the palisade in such
a way that the dead face seemed to be peering around the
edge of the gatepost down the path which led to the jungle.
 
Then Tarzan returned, hunting, always hunting, to the
cabin by the beach.
 
It took a dozen attempts on the part of the thoroughly
frightened blacks to reenter their village, past the horrible,
grinning face of their dead fellow, and when they found the
food and arrows gone they knew, what they had only too well
feared, that Mirando had seen the evil spirit of the jungle.
 
That now seemed to them the logical explanation.  Only
those who saw this terrible god of the jungle died; for was it
not true that none left alive in the village had ever seen him?
Therefore, those who had died at his hands must have seen
him and paid the penalty with their lives.
 
As long as they supplied him with arrows and food he
would not harm them unless they looked upon him, so it was
ordered by Mbonga that in addition to the food offering there
should also be laid out an offering of arrows for this Munan-
go-Keewati, and this was done from then on.
 
If you ever chance to pass that far off African village you
will still see before a tiny thatched hut, built just without the
village, a little iron pot in which is a quantity of food, and
beside it a quiver of well-daubed arrows.
 
When Tarzan came in sight of the beach where stood his
cabin, a strange and unusual spectacle met his vision.
 
On the placid waters of the landlocked harbor floated a
great ship, and on the beach a small boat was drawn up.
 
But, most wonderful of all, a number of white men like
himself were moving about between the beach and his cabin.
 
Tarzan saw that in many ways they were like the men of his
picture books.  He crept closer through the trees until he
was quite close above them.
 
There were ten men, swarthy, sun-tanned, villainous looking
fellows.  Now they had congregated by the boat and were
talking in loud, angry tones, with much gesticulating and
shaking of fists.
 
Presently one of them, a little, mean-faced, black-bearded
fellow with a countenance which reminded Tarzan of Pamba,
the rat, laid his hand upon the shoulder of a giant who stood
next him, and with whom all the others had been arguing and
quarreling.
 
The little man pointed inland, so that the giant was forced
to turn away from the others to look in the direction
indicated.  As he turned, the little, mean-faced man drew a
revolver from his belt and shot the giant in the back.
 
The big fellow threw his hands above his head, his knees
bent beneath him, and without a sound he tumbled forward
upon the beach, dead.
 
The report of the weapon, the first that Tarzan had ever
heard, filled him with wonderment, but even this unaccustomed
sound could not startle his healthy nerves into even a
semblance of panic.
 
The conduct of the white strangers it was that caused him
the greatest perturbation.  He puckered his brows into a
frown of deep thought.  It was well, thought he, that he had
not given way to his first impulse to rush forward and greet
these white men as brothers.
 
They were evidently no different from the black men--no
more civilized than the apes--no less cruel than Sabor.
 
For a moment the others stood looking at the little, mean-
faced man and the giant lying dead upon the beach.
 
Then one of them laughed and slapped the little man upon
the back.  There was much more talk and gesticulating, but
less quarreling.
 
Presently they launched the boat and all jumped into it and
rowed away toward the great ship, where Tarzan could see
other figures moving about upon the deck.
 
When they had clambered aboard, Tarzan dropped to earth
behind a great tree and crept to his cabin, keeping it
always between himself and the ship.
 
Slipping in at the door he found that everything had been
ransacked.  His books and pencils strewed the floor.  His weapons
and shields and other little store of treasures were littered about.
 
As he saw what had been done a great wave of anger
surged through him, and the new made scar upon his forehead
stood suddenly out, a bar of inflamed crimson against
his tawny hide.
 
Quickly he ran to the cupboard and searched in the far recess
of the lower shelf.  Ah!  He breathed a sigh of relief as he
drew out the little tin box, and, opening it, found his greatest
treasures undisturbed.
 
The photograph of the smiling, strong-faced young man,
and the little black puzzle book were safe.
 
What was that?
 
His quick ear had caught a faint but unfamiliar sound.
 
Running to the window Tarzan looked toward the harbor,
and there he saw that a boat was being lowered from the
great ship beside the one already in the water.  Soon he saw
many people clambering over the sides of the larger vessel and
dropping into the boats.  They were coming back in full force.
 
For a moment longer Tarzan watched while a number of
boxes and bundles were lowered into the waiting boats, then,
as they shoved off from the ship's side, the ape-man snatched
up a piece of paper, and with a pencil printed on it for a few
moments until it bore several lines of strong, well-made,
almost letter-perfect characters.
 
This notice he stuck upon the door with a small sharp
splinter of wood.  Then gathering up his precious tin box, his
arrows, and as many bows and spears as he could carry, he
hastened through the door and disappeared into the forest.
 
When the two boats were beached upon the silvery sand it
was a strange assortment of humanity that clambered ashore.
 
Some twenty souls in all there were, fifteen of them rough
and villainous appearing seamen.
 
The others of the party were of different stamp.
 
One was an elderly man, with white hair and large rimmed
spectacles.  His slightly stooped shoulders were draped in an
ill-fitting, though immaculate, frock coat, and a shiny silk hat
added to the incongruity of his garb in an African jungle.
 
The second member of the party to land was a tall young man
in white ducks, while directly behind came another elderly
man with a very high forehead and a fussy, excitable manner.
 
After these came a huge Negress clothed like Solomon as to
colors.  Her great eyes rolled in evident terror, first toward
the jungle and then toward the cursing band of sailors who
were removing the bales and boxes from the boats.
 
The last member of the party to disembark was a girl of
about nineteen, and it was the young man who stood at the
boat's prow to lift her high and dry upon land.  She gave him a
brave and pretty smile of thanks, but no words passed between them.
 
In silence the party advanced toward the cabin.  It was evident
that whatever their intentions, all had been decided upon
before they left the ship; and so they came to the door, the
sailors carrying the boxes and bales, followed by the five who
were of so different a class.  The men put down their burdens,
and then one caught sight of the notice which Tarzan had posted.
 
"Ho, mates!" he cried.  "What's here?  This sign was not
posted an hour ago or I'll eat the cook."
 
The others gathered about, craning their necks over the
shoulders of those before them, but as few of them could
read at all, and then only after the most laborious fashion,
one finally turned to the little old man of the top hat and
frock coat.
 
"Hi, perfesser," he called, "step for'rd and read the
bloomin' notis."
 
Thus addressed, the old man came slowly to where the
sailors stood, followed by the other members of his party.
Adjusting his spectacles he looked for a moment at the
placard and then, turning away, strolled off muttering to
himself:  "Most remarkable--most remarkable!"
 
"Hi, old fossil," cried the man who had first called on him
for assistance, "did je think we wanted of you to read the
bloomin' notis to yourself?  Come back here and read it out
loud, you old barnacle."
 
The old man stopped and, turning back, said:  "Oh, yes,
my dear sir, a thousand pardons.  It was quite thoughtless of
me, yes--very thoughtless.  Most remarkable--most remarkable!"
 
Again he faced the notice and read it through, and doubtless
would have turned off again to ruminate upon it had not
the sailor grasped him roughly by the collar and howled into
his ear.
 
"Read it out loud, you blithering old idiot."
 
"Ah, yes indeed, yes indeed," replied the professor softly,
and adjusting his spectacles once more he read aloud:
 
      THIS IS THE HOUSE OF TARZAN, THE
  KILLER OF BEASTS AND MANY BLACK
  MEN.  DO NOT HARM THE THINGS WHICH
  ARE TARZAN'S.  TARZAN WATCHES.
      TARZAN OF THE APES.
 
 
"Who the devil is Tarzan?" cried the sailor who had before spoken.
 
"He evidently speaks English," said the young man.
 
"But what does `Tarzan of the Apes' mean?" cried the girl.
 
"I do not know, Miss Porter," replied the young man, "unless
we have discovered a runaway simian from the London
Zoo who has brought back a European education to his jungle
home.  What do you make of it, Professor Porter?" he
added, turning to the old man.
 
Professor Archimedes Q. Porter adjusted his spectacles.
 
"Ah, yes, indeed; yes indeed--most remarkable, most
remarkable!" said the professor; "but I can add nothing further
to what I have already remarked in elucidation of this truly
momentous occurrence," and the professor turned slowly in
the direction of the jungle.
 
"But, papa," cried the girl, "you haven't said anything
about it yet."
 
"Tut, tut, child; tut, tut," responded Professor Porter, in a
kindly and indulgent tone, "do not trouble your pretty head
with such weighty and abstruse problems," and again he wandered
slowly off in still another direction, his eyes bent upon
the ground at his feet, his hands clasped behind him beneath
the flowing tails of his coat.
 
"I reckon the daffy old bounder don't know no more'n we
do about it," growled the rat-faced sailor.
 
"Keep a civil tongue in your head," cried the young man,
his face paling in anger, at the insulting tone of the sailor.
"You've murdered our officers and robbed us.  We are absolutely
in your power, but you'll treat Professor Porter and
Miss Porter with respect or I'll break that vile neck of yours
with my bare hands--guns or no guns," and the young fellow
stepped so close to the rat-faced sailor that the latter, though
he bore two revolvers and a villainous looking knife in his
belt, slunk back abashed.
 
"You damned coward," cried the young man.  "You'd never
dare shoot a man until his back was turned.  You don't
dare shoot me even then," and he deliberately turned his
back full upon the sailor and walked nonchalantly away as
if to put him to the test.
 
The sailor's hand crept slyly to the butt of one of his
revolvers; his wicked eyes glared vengefully at the retreating
form of the young Englishman.  The gaze of his fellows was upon
him, but still he hesitated.  At heart he was even a greater
coward than Mr. William Cecil Clayton had imagined.
 
Two keen eyes had watched every move of the party from
the foliage of a nearby tree.  Tarzan had seen the surprise
caused by his notice, and while he could understand nothing
of the spoken language of these strange people their gestures
and facial expressions told him much.
 
The act of the little rat-faced sailor in killing one of his
comrades had aroused a strong dislike in Tarzan, and now
that he saw him quarreling with the fine-looking young man
his animosity was still further stirred.
 
Tarzan had never seen the effects of a firearm before,
though his books had taught him something of them, but
when he saw the rat-faced one fingering the butt of his
revolver he thought of the scene he had witnessed so short
a time before, and naturally expected to see the young man
murdered as had been the huge sailor earlier in the day.
 
So Tarzan fitted a poisoned arrow to his bow and drew a
bead upon the rat-faced sailor, but the foliage was so thick
that he soon saw the arrow would be deflected by the leaves
or some small branch, and instead he launched a heavy spear
from his lofty perch.
 
Clayton had taken but a dozen steps.  The rat-faced sailor
had half drawn his revolver; the other sailors stood watching
the scene intently.
 
Professor Porter had already disappeared into the jungle,
whither he was being followed by the fussy Samuel T.
Philander, his secretary and assistant.
 
Esmeralda, the Negress, was busy sorting her mistress' baggage
from the pile of bales and boxes beside the cabin, and
Miss Porter had turned away to follow Clayton, when something
caused her to turn again toward the sailor.
 
And then three things happened almost simultaneously.
The sailor jerked out his weapon and leveled it at Clayton's
back, Miss Porter screamed a warning, and a long, metal-
shod spear shot like a bolt from above and passed entirely
through the right shoulder of the rat-faced man.
 
The revolver exploded harmlessly in the air, and the seaman
crumpled up with a scream of pain and terror.
 
Clayton turned and rushed back toward the scene.  The
sailors stood in a frightened group, with drawn weapons,
peering into the jungle.  The wounded man writhed and
shrieked upon the ground.
 
Clayton, unseen by any, picked up the fallen revolver and
slipped it inside his shirt, then he joined the sailors in
gazing, mystified, into the jungle.
 
"Who could it have been?" whispered Jane Porter, and the
young man turned to see her standing, wide-eyed and
wondering, close beside him.
 
"I dare say Tarzan of the Apes is watching us all right," he
answered, in a dubious tone.  "I wonder, now, who that spear
was intended for.  If for Snipes, then our ape friend is a
friend indeed.
 
"By jove, where are your father and Mr. Philander?
There's someone or something in that jungle, and it's armed,
whatever it is.  Ho!  Professor!  Mr. Philander!" young Clayton
shouted.  There was no response.
 
"What's to be done, Miss Porter?" continued the young
man, his face clouded by a frown of worry and indecision.
 
"I can't leave you here alone with these cutthroats, and
you certainly can't venture into the jungle with me; yet
someone must go in search of your father.  He is more than
apt to wandering off aimlessly, regardless of danger or
direction, and Mr. Philander is only a trifle less impractical
than he.  You will pardon my bluntness, but our lives are
all in jeopardy here, and when we get your father back
something must be done to impress upon him the dangers to
which he exposes you as well as himself by his absent-mindedness."
 
"I quite agree with you," replied the girl, "and I am not
offended at all.  Dear old papa would sacrifice his life for me
without an instant's hesitation, provided one could keep his
mind on so frivolous a matter for an entire instant.  There is
only one way to keep him in safety, and that is to chain him
to a tree.  The poor dear is SO impractical."
 
"I have it!" suddenly exclaimed Clayton.  "You can use a
revolver, can't you?"
 
"Yes.  Why?"
 
"I have one.  With it you and Esmeralda will be comparatively
safe in this cabin while I am searching for your father
and Mr. Philander.  Come, call the woman and I will hurry
on.  They can't have gone far."
 
Jane did as he suggested and when he saw the door close
safely behind them Clayton turned toward the jungle.
 
Some of the sailors were drawing the spear from their
wounded comrade and, as Clayton approached, he asked if
he could borrow a revolver from one of them while he
searched the jungle for the professor.
 
The rat-faced one, finding he was not dead, had regained
his composure, and with a volley of oaths directed at Clayton
refused in the name of his fellows to allow the young man
any firearms.
 
This man, Snipes, had assumed the role of chief since he
had killed their former leader, and so little time had elapsed
that none of his companions had as yet questioned his authority.
 
Clayton's only response was a shrug of the shoulders, but
as he left them he picked up the spear which had transfixed
Snipes, and thus primitively armed, the son of the then Lord
Greystoke strode into the dense jungle.
 
Every few moments he called aloud the names of the wanderers.
The watchers in the cabin by the beach heard the sound of his
voice growing ever fainter and fainter, until at last it was
swallowed up by the myriad noises of the primeval wood.
 
When Professor Archimedes Q. Porter and his assistant,
Samuel T. Philander, after much insistence on the part of the
latter, had finally turned their steps toward camp, they were
as completely lost in the wild and tangled labyrinth of the
matted jungle as two human beings well could be, though
they did not know it.
 
It was by the merest caprice of fortune that they headed
toward the west coast of Africa, instead of toward Zanzibar
on the opposite side of the dark continent.
 
When in a short time they reached the beach, only to find
no camp in sight, Philander was positive that they were north
of their proper destination, while, as a matter of fact they
were about two hundred yards south of it.
 
It never occurred to either of these impractical theorists to
call aloud on the chance of attracting their friends' attention.
Instead, with all the assurance that deductive reasoning from
a wrong premise induces in one, Mr. Samuel T. Philander
grasped Professor Archimedes Q. Porter firmly by the arm
and hurried the weakly protesting old gentleman off in the
direction of Cape Town, fifteen hundred miles to the south.
 
When Jane and Esmeralda found themselves safely behind
the cabin door the Negress's first thought was to barricade
the portal from the inside.  With this idea in mind she turned
to search for some means of putting it into execution; but her
first view of the interior of the cabin brought a shriek of
terror to her lips, and like a frightened child the huge woman
ran to bury her face on her mistress' shoulder.
 
Jane, turning at the cry, saw the cause of it lying prone
upon the floor before them--the whitened skeleton of a man.
A further glance revealed a second skeleton upon the bed.
 
"What horrible place are we in?" murmured the awe-struck
girl.  But there was no panic in her fright.
 
At last, disengaging herself from the frantic clutch of the still
shrieking Esmeralda, Jane crossed the room to look into the little
cradle, knowing what she should see there even before the tiny
skeleton disclosed itself in all its pitiful and pathetic frailty.
 
What an awful tragedy these poor mute bones proclaimed!
The girl shuddered at thought of the eventualities which
might lie before herself and her friends in this ill-fated
cabin, the haunt of mysterious, perhaps hostile, beings.
 
Quickly, with an impatient stamp of her little foot, she
endeavored to shake off the gloomy forebodings, and turning to
Esmeralda bade her cease her wailing.
 
"Stop, Esmeralda, stop it this minute!" she cried.  "You are
only making it worse."
 
She ended lamely, a little quiver in her own voice as she
thought of the three men, upon whom she depended for
protection, wandering in the depth of that awful forest.
 
Soon the girl found that the door was equipped with a
heavy wooden bar upon the inside, and after several efforts
the combined strength of the two enabled them to slip it into
place, the first time in twenty years.
 
Then they sat down upon a bench with their arms about
one another, and waited.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
After Clayton had plunged into the jungle, the sailors
--mutineers of the Arrow--fell into a discussion of their
next step; but on one point all were agreed--that they should
hasten to put off to the anchored Arrow, where they could at
least be safe from the spears of their unseen foe.  And so,
while Jane Porter and Esmeralda were barricading themselves
within the cabin, the cowardly crew of cutthroats were pulling
rapidly for their ship in the two boats that had brought them ashore.
 
So much had Tarzan seen that day that his head was in a
whirl of wonder.  But the most wonderful sight of all, to him,
was the face of the beautiful white girl.
 
Here at last was one of his own kind; of that he was positive.
And the young man and the two old men; they, too,
were much as he had pictured his own people to be.
 
But doubtless they were as ferocious and cruel as other
men he had seen.  The fact that they alone of all the party
were unarmed might account for the fact that they had killed
no one.  They might be very different if provided with weapons.
 
Tarzan had seen the young man pick up the fallen revolver
of the wounded Snipes and hide it away in his breast; and he
had also seen him slip it cautiously to the girl as she entered
the cabin door.
 
He did not understand anything of the motives behind all
that he had seen; but, somehow, intuitively he liked the
young man and the two old men, and for the girl he had a
strange longing which he scarcely understood.  As for the big
black woman, she was evidently connected in some way to
the girl, and so he liked her, also.
 
For the sailors, and especially Snipes, he had developed a
great hatred.  He knew by their threatening gestures and by
the expression upon their evil faces that they were enemies
of the others of the party, and so he decided to watch closely.
 
Tarzan wondered why the men had gone into the jungle,
nor did it ever occur to him that one could become lost in
that maze of undergrowth which to him was as simple as is the
main street of your own home town to you.
 
When he saw the sailors row away toward the ship, and
knew that the girl and her companion were safe in his cabin,
Tarzan decided to follow the young man into the jungle and
learn what his errand might be.  He swung off rapidly in the
direction taken by Clayton, and in a short time heard faintly
in the distance the now only occasional calls of the Englishman
to his friends.
 
Presently Tarzan came up with the white man, who, almost
fagged, was leaning against a tree wiping the perspiration
from his forehead.  The ape-man, hiding safe behind a
screen of foliage, sat watching this new specimen of his own
race intently.
 
At intervals Clayton called aloud and finally it came to
Tarzan that he was searching for the old man.
 
Tarzan was on the point of going off to look for them himself,
when he caught the yellow glint of a sleek hide moving
cautiously through the jungle toward Clayton.
 
It was Sheeta, the leopard.  Now, Tarzan heard the soft
bending of grasses and wondered why the young white man
was not warned.  Could it be he had failed to note the loud
warning?  Never before had Tarzan known Sheeta to be so clumsy.
 
No, the white man did not hear.  Sheeta was crouching for
the spring, and then, shrill and horrible, there rose from the
stillness of the jungle the awful cry of the challenging ape,
and Sheeta turned, crashing into the underbrush.
 
Clayton came to his feet with a start.  His blood ran cold.
Never in all his life had so fearful a sound smote upon his
ears.  He was no coward; but if ever man felt the icy fingers
of fear upon his heart, William Cecil Clayton, eldest son of
Lord Greystoke of England, did that day in the fastness of
the African jungle.
 
The noise of some great body crashing through the underbrush
so close beside him, and the sound of that bloodcurdling
shriek from above, tested Clayton's courage to the limit;
but he could not know that it was to that very voice he owed
his life, nor that the creature who hurled it forth was his own
cousin--the real Lord Greystoke.
 
The afternoon was drawing to a close, and Clayton,
disheartened and discouraged, was in a terrible quandary as to
the proper course to pursue; whether to keep on in search of
Professor Porter, at the almost certain risk of his own death
in the jungle by night, or to return to the cabin where he
might at least serve to protect Jane from the perils which
confronted her on all sides.
 
He did not wish to return to camp without her father; still
more, he shrank from the thought of leaving her alone and
unprotected in the hands of the mutineers of the Arrow,
or to the hundred unknown dangers of the jungle.
 
Possibly, too, he thought, the professor and Philander
might have returned to camp.  Yes, that was more than likely.
At least he would return and see, before he continued what
seemed to be a most fruitless quest.  And so he started,
stumbling back through the thick and matted underbrush in the
direction that he thought the cabin lay.
 
To Tarzan's surprise the young man was heading further
into the jungle in the general direction of Mbonga's village,
and the shrewd young ape-man was convinced that he was lost.
 
To Tarzan this was scarcely incomprehensible; his judgment
told him that no man would venture toward the village of the
cruel blacks armed only with a spear which, from the awkward
way in which he carried it, was evidently an unaccustomed
weapon to this white man.  Nor was he following the
trail of the old men.  That, they had crossed and left long
since, though it had been fresh and plain before Tarzan's eyes.
 
Tarzan was perplexed.  The fierce jungle would make easy
prey of this unprotected stranger in a very short time if he
were not guided quickly to the beach.
 
Yes, there was Numa, the lion, even now, stalking the
white man a dozen paces to the right.
 
Clayton heard the great body paralleling his course, and
now there rose upon the evening air the beast's thunderous
roar.  The man stopped with upraised spear and faced the
brush from which issued the awful sound.  The shadows were
deepening, darkness was settling in.
 
God!  To die here alone, beneath the fangs of wild beasts;
to be torn and rended; to feel the hot breath of the brute on
his face as the great paw crushed down up his breast!
 
For a moment all was still.  Clayton stood rigid, with raised
spear.  Presently a faint rustling of the bush apprised him of
the stealthy creeping of the thing behind.  It was gathering for
the spring.  At last he saw it, not twenty feet away--the long,
lithe, muscular body and tawny head of a huge black-maned lion.
 
The beast was upon its belly, moving forward very slowly.
As its eyes met Clayton's it stopped, and deliberately,
cautiously gathered its hind quarters behind it.
 
In agony the man watched, fearful to launch his spear,
powerless to fly.
 
He heard a noise in the tree above him.  Some new danger,
he thought, but he dared not take his eyes from the yellow
green orbs before him.  There was a sharp twang as of a broken
banjo-string, and at the same instant an arrow appeared
in the yellow hide of the crouching lion.
 
With a roar of pain and anger the beast sprang; but, somehow,
Clayton stumbled to one side, and as he turned again to
face the infuriated king of beasts, he was appalled at the sight
which confronted him.  Almost simultaneously with the lion's
turning to renew the attack a half-naked giant dropped from
the tree above squarely on the brute's back.
 
With lightning speed an arm that was banded layers of iron
muscle encircled the huge neck, and the great beast was
raised from behind, roaring and pawing the air--raised as
easily as Clayton would have lifted a pet dog.
 
The scene he witnessed there in the twilight depths of the
African jungle was burned forever into the Englishman's brain.
 
The man before him was the embodiment of physical perfection
and giant strength; yet it was not upon these he depended
in his battle with the great cat, for mighty as were his
muscles, they were as nothing by comparison with Numa's.
To his agility, to his brain and to his long keen knife he
owed his supremacy.
 
His right arm encircled the lion's neck, while the left hand
plunged the knife time and again into the unprotected side
behind the left shoulder.  The infuriated beast, pulled up and
backwards until he stood upon his hind legs, struggled
impotently in this unnatural position.
 
Had the battle been of a few seconds' longer duration the
outcome might have been different, but it was all accomplished
so quickly that the lion had scarce time to recover from the
confusion of its surprise ere it sank lifeless to the ground.
 
Then the strange figure which had vanquished it stood
erect upon the carcass, and throwing back the wild and
handsome head, gave out the fearsome cry which a few moments
earlier had so startled Clayton.
 
Before him he saw the figure of a young man, naked except
for a loin cloth and a few barbaric ornaments about
arms and legs; on the breast a priceless diamond locket
gleaming against a smooth brown skin.
 
The hunting knife had been returned to its homely sheath,
and the man was gathering up his bow and quiver from
where he had tossed them when he leaped to attack the lion.
 
Clayton spoke to the stranger in English, thanking him for
his brave rescue and complimenting him on the wondrous
strength and dexterity he had displayed, but the only answer
was a steady stare and a faint shrug of the mighty shoulders,
which might betoken either disparagement of the service
rendered, or ignorance of Clayton's language.
 
When the bow and quiver had been slung to his back the
wild man, for such Clayton now thought him, once more
drew his knife and deftly carved a dozen large strips of meat
from the lion's carcass.  Then, squatting upon his haunches,
he proceeded to eat, first motioning Clayton to join him.
 
The strong white teeth sank into the raw and dripping flesh
in apparent relish of the meal, but Clayton could not bring
himself to share the uncooked meat with his strange host;
instead he watched him, and presently there dawned upon him
the conviction that this was Tarzan of the Apes, whose notice
he had seen posted upon the cabin door that morning.
 
If so he must speak English.
 
Again Clayton attempted speech with the ape-man; but the
replies, now vocal, were in a strange tongue, which resembled
the chattering of monkeys mingled with the growling of some
wild beast.
 
No, this could not be Tarzan of the Apes, for it was very
evident that he was an utter stranger to English.
 
When Tarzan had completed his repast he rose and, pointing
a very different direction from that which Clayton had
been pursuing, started off through the jungle toward the point
he had indicated.
 
Clayton, bewildered and confused, hesitated to follow him,
for he thought he was but being led more deeply into the
mazes of the forest; but the ape-man, seeing him disinclined
to follow, returned, and, grasping him by the coat, dragged
him along until he was convinced that Clayton understood what
was required of him.  Then he left him to follow voluntarily.
 
The Englishman, finally concluding that he was a prisoner,
saw no alternative open but to accompany his captor, and
thus they traveled slowly through the jungle while the sable
mantle of the impenetrable forest night fell about them, and
the stealthy footfalls of padded paws mingled with the breaking
of twigs and the wild calls of the savage life that Clayton
felt closing in upon him.
 
Suddenly Clayton heard the faint report of a firearm--a
single shot, and then silence.
 
In the cabin by the beach two thoroughly terrified women
clung to each other as they crouched upon the low bench in
the gathering darkness.
 
The Negress sobbed hysterically, bemoaning the evil day
that had witnessed her departure from her dear Maryland,
while the white girl, dry eyed and outwardly calm, was torn
by inward fears and forebodings.  She feared not more for
herself than for the three men whom she knew to be wandering
in the abysmal depths of the savage jungle, from which
she now heard issuing the almost incessant shrieks and roars,
barkings and growlings of its terrifying and fearsome denizens
as they sought their prey.
 
And now there came the sound of a heavy body brushing
against the side of the cabin.  She could hear the great padded
paws upon the ground outside.  For an instant, all was silence;
even the bedlam of the forest died to a faint murmur.  Then
she distinctly heard the beast outside sniffing at the door, not
two feet from where she crouched.  Instinctively the girl
shuddered, and shrank closer to the black woman.
 
"Hush!" she whispered.  "Hush, Esmeralda," for the
woman's sobs and groans seemed to have attracted the thing
that stalked there just beyond the thin wall.
 
A gentle scratching sound was heard on the door.  The
brute tried to force an entrance; but presently this ceased,
and again she heard the great pads creeping stealthily around
the cabin.  Again they stopped--beneath the window on
which the terrified eyes of the girl now glued themselves.
 
"God!" she murmured, for now, silhouetted against the
moonlit sky beyond, she saw framed in the tiny square of the
latticed window the head of a huge lioness.  The gleaming
eyes were fixed upon her in intent ferocity.
 
"Look, Esmeralda!" she whispered.  "For God's sake, what
shall we do?  Look!  Quick!  The window!"
 
Esmeralda, cowering still closer to her mistress, took one
frightened glance toward the little square of moonlight, just
as the lioness emitted a low, savage snarl.
 
The sight that met the poor woman's eyes was too much
for the already overstrung nerves.
 
"Oh, Gaberelle!" she shrieked, and slid to the floor an inert
and senseless mass.
 
For what seemed an eternity the great brute stood with its
forepaws upon the sill, glaring into the little room.  Presently
it tried the strength of the lattice with its great talons.
 
The girl had almost ceased to breathe, when, to her relief,
the head disappeared and she heard the brute's footsteps leaving
the window.  But now they came to the door again, and
once more the scratching commenced; this time with increasing
force until the great beast was tearing at the massive panels
in a perfect frenzy of eagerness to seize its defenseless victims.
 
Could Jane have known the immense strength of that door,
built piece by piece, she would have felt less fear of the
lioness reaching her by this avenue.
 
Little did John Clayton imagine when he fashioned that
crude but mighty portal that one day, twenty years later, it
would shield a fair American girl, then unborn, from the
teeth and talons of a man-eater.
 
For fully twenty minutes the brute alternately sniffed and
tore at the door, occasionally giving voice to a wild, savage
cry of baffled rage.  At length, however, she gave up the
attempt, and Jane heard her returning toward the window,
beneath which she paused for an instant, and then launched
her great weight against the timeworn lattice.
 
The girl heard the wooden rods groan beneath the impact; but
they held, and the huge body dropped back to the ground below.
 
Again and again the lioness repeated these tactics, until
finally the horrified prisoner within saw a portion of the
lattice give way, and in an instant one great paw and the head
of the animal were thrust within the room.
 
Slowly the powerful neck and shoulders spread the bars
apart, and the lithe body protruded farther and farther into
the room.
 
As in a trance, the girl rose, her hand upon her breast,
wide eyes staring horror-stricken into the snarling face of the
beast scarce ten feet from her.  At her feet lay the prostrate
form of the Negress.  If she could but arouse her, their combined
efforts might possibly avail to beat back the fierce and
bloodthirsty intruder.
 
Jane stooped to grasp the black woman by the shoulder.
Roughly she shook her.
 
"Esmeralda!  Esmeralda!" she cried.  "Help me, or we are lost."
 
Esmeralda opened her eyes.  The first object they
encountered was the dripping fangs of the hungry lioness.
 
With a horrified scream the poor woman rose to her hands and
knees, and in this position scurried across the room, shrieking: 
"O Gaberelle!  O Gaberelle!" at the top of her lungs.
 
Esmeralda weighed some two hundred and eighty pounds,
and her extreme haste, added to her extreme corpulency,
produced a most amazing result when Esmeralda elected to
travel on all fours.
 
For a moment the lioness remained quiet with intense gaze
directed upon the flitting Esmeralda, whose goal appeared to
be the cupboard, into which she attempted to propel her huge
bulk; but as the shelves were but nine or ten inches apart, she
only succeeded in getting her head in; whereupon, with a final
screech, which paled the jungle noises into insignificance, she
fainted once again.
 
With the subsidence of Esmeralda the lioness renewed her
efforts to wriggle her huge bulk through the weakening lattice.
 
The girl, standing pale and rigid against the farther wall,
sought with ever-increasing terror for some loophole of escape.
Suddenly her hand, tight-pressed against her bosom, felt
the hard outline of the revolver that Clayton had left with
her earlier in the day.
 
Quickly she snatched it from its hiding-place, and, leveling
it full at the lioness's face, pulled the trigger.
 
There was a flash of flame, the roar of the discharge, and
an answering roar of pain and anger from the beast.
 
Jane Porter saw the great form disappear from the window,
and then she, too, fainted, the revolver falling at her side.
 
But Sabor was not killed.  The bullet had but inflicted a
painful wound in one of the great shoulders.  It was the
surprise at the blinding flash and the deafening roar that had
caused her hasty but temporary retreat.
 
In another instant she was back at the lattice, and with
renewed fury was clawing at the aperture, but with lessened
effect, since the wounded member was almost useless.
 
She saw her prey--the two women--lying senseless upon
the floor.  There was no longer any resistance to be overcome.
Her meat lay before her, and Sabor had only to worm her
way through the lattice to claim it.
 
Slowly she forced her great bulk, inch by inch, through the
opening.  Now her head was through, now one great forearm
and shoulder.
 
Carefully she drew up the wounded member to insinuate it
gently beyond the tight pressing bars.
 
A moment more and both shoulders through, the long,
sinuous body and the narrow hips would glide quickly after.
 
It was on this sight that Jane Porter again opened her eyes.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
When Clayton heard the report of the firearm he fell into
an agony of fear and apprehension.  He knew that one of
the sailors might be the author of it; but the fact that he
had left the revolver with Jane, together with the overwrought
condition of his nerves, made him morbidly positive
that she was threatened with some great danger.  Perhaps
even now she was attempting to defend herself against some
savage man or beast.
 
What were the thoughts of his strange captor or guide
Clayton could only vaguely conjecture; but that he had heard
the shot, and was in some manner affected by it was quite
evident, for he quickened his pace so appreciably that Clayton,
stumbling blindly in his wake, was down a dozen times
in as many minutes in a vain effort to keep pace with him,
and soon was left hopelessly behind.
 
Fearing that he would again be irretrievably lost, he called
aloud to the wild man ahead of him, and in a moment had the
satisfaction of seeing him drop lightly to his side from the
branches above.
 
For a moment Tarzan looked at the young man closely, as
though undecided as to just what was best to do; then,
stooping down before Clayton, he motioned him to grasp him
about the neck, and, with the white man upon his back,
Tarzan took to the trees.
 
The next few minutes the young Englishman never forgot.
High into bending and swaying branches he was borne with
what seemed to him incredible swiftness, while Tarzan chafed
at the slowness of his progress.
 
From one lofty branch the agile creature swung with Clayton
through a dizzy arc to a neighboring tree; then for a hundred
yards maybe the sure feet threaded a maze of interwoven limbs,
balancing like a tightrope walker high above the black depths
of verdure beneath.
 
From the first sensation of chilling fear Clayton passed to
one of keen admiration and envy of those giant muscles and
that wondrous instinct or knowledge which guided this forest
god through the inky blackness of the night as easily and safely
as Clayton would have strolled a London street at high noon.
 
Occasionally they would enter a spot where the foliage
above was less dense, and the bright rays of the moon lit up
before Clayton's wondering eyes the strange path they were
traversing.
 
At such times the man fairly caught his breath at sight of
the horrid depths below them, for Tarzan took the easiest
way, which often led over a hundred feet above the earth.
 
And yet with all his seeming speed, Tarzan was in reality
feeling his way with comparative slowness, searching
constantly for limbs of adequate strength for the maintenance
of this double weight.
 
Presently they came to the clearing before the beach.
Tarzan's quick ears had heard the strange sounds of Sabor's
efforts to force her way through the lattice, and it seemed to
Clayton that they dropped a straight hundred feet to earth, so
quickly did Tarzan descend.  Yet when they struck the ground
it was with scarce a jar; and as Clayton released his hold on
the ape-man he saw him dart like a squirrel for the opposite
side of the cabin.
 
The Englishman sprang quickly after him just in time to
see the hind quarters of some huge animal about to disappear
through the window of the cabin.
 
As Jane opened her eyes to a realization of the imminent
peril which threatened her, her brave young heart gave up at
last its final vestige of hope.  But then to her surprise she saw
the huge animal being slowly drawn back through the window,
and in the moonlight beyond she saw the heads and
shoulders of two men.
 
As Clayton rounded the corner of the cabin to behold the
animal disappearing within, it was also to see the ape-man
seize the long tail in both hands, and, bracing himself with
his feet against the side of the cabin, throw all his mighty
strength into the effort to draw the beast out of the interior.
 
Clayton was quick to lend a hand, but the ape-man jabbered
to him in a commanding and peremptory tone something
which Clayton knew to be orders, though he could not
understand them.
 
At last, under their combined efforts, the great body was
slowly dragged farther and farther outside the window, and
then there came to Clayton's mind a dawning conception of
the rash bravery of his companion's act.
 
For a naked man to drag a shrieking, clawing man-eater
forth from a window by the tail to save a strange white girl,
was indeed the last word in heroism.
 
Insofar as Clayton was concerned it was a very different
matter, since the girl was not only of his own kind and race,
but was the one woman in all the world whom he loved.
 
Though he knew that the lioness would make short work
of both of them, he pulled with a will to keep it from Jane
Porter.  And then he recalled the battle between this man and
the great, black-maned lion which he had witnessed a short
time before, and he commenced to feel more assurance.
 
Tarzan was still issuing orders which Clayton could not understand.
 
He was trying to tell the stupid white man to plunge his
poisoned arrows into Sabor's back and sides, and to reach the
savage heart with the long, thin hunting knife that hung at
Tarzan's hip; but the man would not understand, and Tarzan
did not dare release his hold to do the things himself, for he
knew that the puny white man never could hold mighty
Sabor alone, for an instant.
 
Slowly the lioness was emerging from the window.  At last
her shoulders were out.
 
And then Clayton saw an incredible thing.  Tarzan, racking
his brains for some means to cope single-handed with the
infuriated beast, had suddenly recalled his battle with Terkoz;
and as the great shoulders came clear of the window, so that
the lioness hung upon the sill only by her forepaws, Tarzan
suddenly released his hold upon the brute.
 
With the quickness of a striking rattler he launched himself
full upon Sabor's back, his strong young arms seeking and
gaining a full-Nelson upon the beast, as he had learned it that
other day during his bloody, wrestling victory over Terkoz.
 
With a roar the lioness turned completely over upon her
back, falling full upon her enemy; but the black-haired giant
only closed tighter his hold.
 
Pawing and tearing at earth and air, Sabor rolled and
threw herself this way and that in an effort to dislodge this
strange antagonist; but ever tighter and tighter drew the iron
bands that were forcing her head lower and lower upon her
tawny breast.
 
Higher crept the steel forearms of the ape-man about the back
of Sabor's neck.  Weaker and weaker became the lioness's efforts.
 
At last Clayton saw the immense muscles of Tarzan's
shoulders and biceps leap into corded knots beneath the silver
moonlight.  There was a long sustained and supreme effort on
the ape-man's part--and the vertebrae of Sabor's neck parted
with a sharp snap.
 
In an instant Tarzan was upon his feet, and for the second
time that day Clayton heard the bull ape's savage roar of
victory.  Then he heard Jane's agonized cry:
 
"Cecil--Mr. Clayton!  Oh, what is it?  What is it?"
 
Running quickly to the cabin door, Clayton called out that all
was right, and shouted to her to open the door.  As quickly as
she could she raised the great bar and fairly dragged Clayton within.
 
"What was that awful noise?" she whispered, shrinking
close to him.
 
"It was the cry of the kill from the throat of the man who
has just saved your life, Miss Porter.  Wait, I will fetch
him so you may thank him."
 
The frightened girl would not be left alone, so she
accompanied Clayton to the side of the cabin where lay
the dead body of the lioness.
 
Tarzan of the Apes was gone.
 
Clayton called several times, but there was no reply, and so
the two returned to the greater safety of the interior.
 
"What a frightful sound!" cried Jane, "I shudder at the
mere thought of it.  Do not tell me that a human throat
voiced that hideous and fearsome shriek."
 
"But it did, Miss Porter," replied Clayton; "or at least if
not a human throat that of a forest god."
 
And then he told her of his experiences with this strange
creature--of how twice the wild man had saved his life--of
the wondrous strength, and agility, and bravery--of the
brown skin and the handsome face.
 
"I cannot make it out at all," he concluded.  "At first I
thought he might be Tarzan of the Apes; but he neither
speaks nor understands English, so that theory is untenable."
 
"Well, whatever he may be," cried the girl, "we owe him
our lives, and may God bless him and keep him in safety in
his wild and savage jungle!"
 
"Amen," said Clayton, fervently.
 
"For the good Lord's sake, ain't I dead?"
 
The two turned to see Esmeralda sitting upright upon the
floor, her great eyes rolling from side to side as though she
could not believe their testimony as to her whereabouts.
 
And now, for Jane Porter, the reaction came, and she threw
herself upon the bench, sobbing with hysterical laughter.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
Several miles south of the cabin, upon a strip of sandy
beach, stood two old men, arguing.
 
Before them stretched the broad Atlantic.  At their backs
was the Dark Continent.  Close around them loomed the
impenetrable blackness of the jungle.
 
Savage beasts roared and growled; noises, hideous and
weird, assailed their ears.  They had wandered for miles in
search of their camp, but always in the wrong direction.  They
were as hopelessly lost as though they suddenly had been
transported to another world.
 
At such a time, indeed, every fiber of their combined
intellects must have been concentrated upon the vital
question of the minute--the life-and-death question to
them of retracing their steps to camp.
 
Samuel T. Philander was speaking.
 
"But, my dear professor," he was saying, "I still maintain
that but for the victories of Ferdinand and Isabella over the
fifteenth-century Moors in Spain the world would be today a
thousand years in advance of where we now find ourselves.
The Moors were essentially a tolerant, broad-minded, liberal
race of agriculturists, artisans and merchants--the very type
of people that has made possible such civilization as we find
today in America and Europe--while the Spaniards--"
 
"Tut, tut, dear Mr. Philander," interrupted Professor Porter;
"their religion positively precluded the possibilities you
suggest.  Moslemism was, is, and always will be, a blight on
that scientific progress which has marked--"
 
"Bless me!  Professor," interjected Mr. Philander, who had
turned his gaze toward the jungle, "there seems to be someone
approaching."
 
Professor Archimedes Q. Porter turned in the direction
indicated by the nearsighted Mr. Philander.
 
"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander," he chided.  "How often must I
urge you to seek that absolute concentration of your mental
faculties which alone may permit you to bring to bear the
highest powers of intellectuality upon the momentous problems
which naturally fall to the lot of great minds?  And now
I find you guilty of a most flagrant breach of courtesy in
interrupting my learned discourse to call attention to a mere
quadruped of the genus FELIS.  As I was saying, Mr.--"
 
"Heavens, Professor, a lion?" cried Mr. Philander, straining
his weak eyes toward the dim figure outlined against the
dark tropical underbrush.
 
"Yes, yes, Mr. Philander, if you insist upon employing
slang in your discourse, a `lion.'  But as I was saying--"
 
"Bless me, Professor," again interrupted Mr. Philander;
"permit me to suggest that doubtless the Moors who were
conquered in the fifteenth century will continue in that most
regrettable condition for the time being at least, even though
we postpone discussion of that world calamity until we may
attain the enchanting view of yon FELIS CARNIVORA which
distance proverbially is credited with lending."
 
In the meantime the lion had approached with quiet dignity
to within ten paces of the two men, where he stood curiously
watching them.
 
The moonlight flooded the beach, and the strange group
stood out in bold relief against the yellow sand.
 
"Most reprehensible, most reprehensible," exclaimed Professor
Porter, with a faint trace of irritation in his voice.
"Never, Mr. Philander, never before in my life have I known
one of these animals to be permitted to roam at large from
its cage.  I shall most certainly report this outrageous breach
of ethics to the directors of the adjacent zoological garden."
 
"Quite right, Professor," agreed Mr. Philander, "and the
sooner it is done the better.  Let us start now."
 
Seizing the professor by the arm, Mr. Philander set off in
the direction that would put the greatest distance between
themselves and the lion.
 
They had proceeded but a short distance when a backward
glance revealed to the horrified gaze of Mr. Philander that
the lion was following them.  He tightened his grip upon the
protesting professor and increased his speed.
 
"As I was saying, Mr. Philander," repeated Professor Porter.
 
Mr. Philander took another hasty glance rearward.  The lion
also had quickened his gait, and was doggedly maintaining an
unvarying distance behind them.
 
"He is following us!" gasped Mr. Philander, breaking into a run.
 
"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander," remonstrated the professor, "this
unseemly haste is most unbecoming to men of letters.  What
will our friends think of us, who may chance to be upon the
street and witness our frivolous antics?  Pray let us proceed
with more decorum."
 
Mr. Philander stole another observation astern.
 
The lion was bounding along in easy leaps scarce five paces behind.
 
Mr. Philander dropped the professor's arm, and broke into
a mad orgy of speed that would have done credit to any
varsity track team.
 
"As I was saying, Mr. Philander--" screamed Professor
Porter, as, metaphorically speaking, he himself "threw her
into high."  He, too, had caught a fleeting backward glimpse
of cruel yellow eyes and half open mouth within startling
proximity of his person.
 
With streaming coat tails and shiny silk hat Professor
Archimedes Q. Porter fled through the moonlight close upon
the heels of Mr. Samuel T. Philander.
 
Before them a point of the jungle ran out toward a narrow
promontory, and it was for the heaven of the trees he saw
there that Mr. Samuel T. Philander directed his prodigious
leaps and bounds; while from the shadows of this same spot
peered two keen eyes in interested appreciation of the race.
 
It was Tarzan of the Apes who watched, with face a-grin,
this odd game of follow-the-leader.
 
He knew the two men were safe enough from attack in so
far as the lion was concerned.  The very fact that Numa had
foregone such easy prey at all convinced the wise forest craft
of Tarzan that Numa's belly already was full.
 
The lion might stalk them until hungry again; but the
chances were that if not angered he would soon tire of the
sport, and slink away to his jungle lair.
 
Really, the one great danger was that one of the men
might stumble and fall, and then the yellow devil would be
upon him in a moment and the joy of the kill would be too
great a temptation to withstand.
 
So Tarzan swung quickly to a lower limb in line with the
approaching fugitives; and as Mr. Samuel T. Philander came
panting and blowing beneath him, already too spent to struggle
up to the safety of the limb, Tarzan reached down and,
grasping him by the collar of his coat, yanked him to the
limb by his side.
 
Another moment brought the professor within the sphere
of the friendly grip, and he, too, was drawn upward to safety
just as the baffled Numa, with a roar, leaped to recover his
vanishing quarry.
 
For a moment the two men clung panting to the great
branch, while Tarzan squatted with his back to the stem of
the tree, watching them with mingled curiosity and amusement.
 
It was the professor who first broke the silence.
 
"I am deeply pained, Mr. Philander, that you should have
evinced such a paucity of manly courage in the presence of
one of the lower orders, and by your crass timidity have
caused me to exert myself to such an unaccustomed degree in
order that I might resume my discourse.  As I was saying, Mr.
Philander, when you interrupted me, the Moors--"
 
"Professor Archimedes Q. Porter," broke in Mr. Philander,
in icy tones, "the time has arrived when patience becomes a
crime and mayhem appears garbed in the mantle of virtue.
You have accused me of cowardice.  You have insinuated that
you ran only to overtake me, not to escape the clutches of
the lion.  Have a care, Professor Archimedes Q. Porter!  I am
a desperate man.  Goaded by long-suffering patience the
worm will turn."
 
"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander, tut, tut!" cautioned Professor
Porter; "you forget yourself."
 
"I forget nothing as yet, Professor Archimedes Q. Porter; but,
believe me, sir, I am tottering on the verge of forgetfulness
as to your exalted position in the world of science, and
your gray hairs."
 
The professor sat in silence for a few minutes, and the
darkness hid the grim smile that wreathed his wrinkled
countenance.  Presently he spoke.
 
"Look here, Skinny Philander," he said, in belligerent tones,
"if you are lookin' for a scrap, peel off your coat and come
on down on the ground, and I'll punch your head just as I
did sixty years ago in the alley back of Porky Evans' barn."
 
"Ark!" gasped the astonished Mr. Philander.  "Lordy, how
good that sounds!  When you're human, Ark, I love you; but
somehow it seems as though you had forgotten how to be
human for the last twenty years."
 
The professor reached out a thin, trembling old hand
through the darkness until it found his old friend's shoulder.
 
"Forgive me, Skinny," he said, softly.  "It hasn't been quite
twenty years, and God alone knows how hard I have tried to
be `human' for Jane's sake, and yours, too, since He took my
other Jane away."
 
Another old hand stole up from Mr. Philander's side to
clasp the one that lay upon his shoulder, and no other message
could better have translated the one heart to the other.
 
They did not speak for some minutes.  The lion below them
paced nervously back and forth.  The third figure in the tree
was hidden by the dense shadows near the stem.  He, too, was
silent--motionless as a graven image.
 
"You certainly pulled me up into this tree just in time,"
said the professor at last.  "I want to thank you.  You saved
my life."
 
"But I didn't pull you up here, Professor," said Mr. Philander.
"Bless me!  The excitement of the moment quite caused
me to forget that I myself was drawn up here by some outside
agency--there must be someone or something in this tree
with us."
 
"Eh?" ejaculated Professor Porter.  "Are you quite positive,
Mr. Philander?"
 
"Most positive, Professor," replied Mr. Philander, "and,"
he added, "I think we should thank the party.  He may be
sitting right next to you now, Professor."
 
"Eh?  What's that?  Tut, tut, Mr. Philander, tut, tut!" said
Professor Porter, edging cautiously nearer to Mr. Philander.
 
Just then it occurred to Tarzan of the Apes that Numa had
loitered beneath the tree for a sufficient length of time, so he
raised his young head toward the heavens, and there rang out
upon the terrified ears of the two old men the awful warning
challenge of the anthropoid.
 
The two friends, huddled trembling in their precarious position
on the limb, saw the great lion halt in his restless pacing as
the blood-curdling cry smote his ears, and then slink
quickly into the jungle, to be instantly lost to view.
 
"Even the lion trembles in fear," whispered Mr. Philander.
 
"Most remarkable, most remarkable," murmured Professor
Porter, clutching frantically at Mr. Philander to regain the
balance which the sudden fright had so perilously endangered.
Unfortunately for them both, Mr. Philander's center
of equilibrium was at that very moment hanging upon the
ragged edge of nothing, so that it needed but the gentle
impetus supplied by the additional weight of Professor Porter's
body to topple the devoted secretary from the limb.
 
For a moment they swayed uncertainly, and then, with
mingled and most unscholarly shrieks, they pitched headlong
from the tree, locked in frenzied embrace.
 
It was quite some moments ere either moved, for both
were positive that any such attempt would reveal so many
breaks and fractures as to make further progress impossible.
 
At length Professor Porter made an attempt to move one leg.
To his surprise, it responded to his will as in days gone
by.  He now drew up its mate and stretched it forth again.
 
"Most remarkable, most remarkable," he murmured.
 
"Thank God, Professor," whispered Mr. Philander, fervently,
"you are not dead, then?"
 
"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander, tut, tut," cautioned Professor
Porter, "I do not know with accuracy as yet."
 
With infinite solicitude Professor Porter wiggled his right
arm--joy!  It was intact.  Breathlessly he waved his left arm
above his prostrate body--it waved!
 
"Most remarkable, most remarkable," he said.
 
"To whom are you signaling, Professor?" asked Mr. Philander,
in an excited tone.
 
Professor Porter deigned to make no response to this
puerile inquiry.  Instead he raised his head gently from
the ground, nodding it back and forth a half dozen times.
 
"Most remarkable," he breathed.  "It remains intact."
 
Mr. Philander had not moved from where he had fallen;
he had not dared the attempt.  How indeed could one move
when one's arms and legs and back were broken?
 
One eye was buried in the soft loam; the other, rolling
sidewise, was fixed in awe upon the strange gyrations of
Professor Porter.
 
"How sad!" exclaimed Mr. Philander, half aloud.  "Concussion
of the brain, superinducing total mental aberration.  How
very sad indeed! and for one still so young!"
 
Professor Porter rolled over upon his stomach; gingerly he
bowed his back until he resembled a huge tom cat in proximity
to a yelping dog.  Then he sat up and felt of various portions
of his anatomy.
 
"They are all here," he exclaimed.  "Most remarkable!"
 
Whereupon he arose, and, bending a scathing glance upon
the still prostrate form of Mr. Samuel T. Philander, he said:
 
"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander; this is no time to indulge in slothful
ease.  We must be up and doing."
 
Mr. Philander lifted his other eye out of the mud and
gazed in speechless rage at Professor Porter.  Then he
attempted to rise; nor could there have been any more
surprised than he when his efforts were immediately crowned
with marked success.
 
He was still bursting with rage, however, at the cruel injustice
of Professor Porter's insinuation, and was on the point of
rendering a tart rejoinder when his eyes fell upon a strange
figure standing a few paces away, scrutinizing them intently.
 
Professor Porter had recovered his shiny silk hat, which he
had brushed carefully upon the sleeve of his coat and replaced
upon his head.  When he saw Mr. Philander pointing to something
behind him he turned to behold a giant, naked but for a loin
cloth and a few metal ornaments, standing motionless before him.
 
"Good evening, sir!" said the professor, lifting his hat.
 
For reply the giant motioned them to follow him, and set off
up the beach in the direction from which they had recently come.
 
"I think it the better part of discretion to follow him," said
Mr. Philander.
 
"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander," returned the professor.  "A short
time since you were advancing a most logical argument in
substantiation of your theory that camp lay directly south of us.
I was skeptical, but you finally convinced me; so now I am
positive that toward the south we must travel to reach our
friends.  Therefore I shall continue south."
 
"But, Professor Porter, this man may know better than either
of us.  He seems to be indigenous to this part of the
world.  Let us at least follow him for a short distance."
 
"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander," repeated the professor.  "I am a
difficult man to convince, but when once convinced my decision
is unalterable.  I shall continue in the proper direction, if
I have to circumambulate the continent of Africa to reach
my destination."
 
Further argument was interrupted by Tarzan, who, seeing
that these strange men were not following him, had returned
to their side.
 
Again he beckoned to them; but still they stood in argument.
 
Presently the ape-man lost patience with their stupid ignorance.
He grasped the frightened Mr. Philander by the shoulder, and
before that worthy gentleman knew whether he was being
killed or merely maimed for life, Tarzan had tied one
end of his rope securely about Mr. Philander's neck.
 
"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander," remonstrated Professor Porter;
"it is most unbeseeming in you to submit to such indignities."
 
But scarcely were the words out of his mouth ere he, too,
had been seized and securely bound by the neck with the
same rope.  Then Tarzan set off toward the north, leading the
now thoroughly frightened professor and his secretary.
 
In deathly silence they proceeded for what seemed hours to
the two tired and hopeless old men; but presently as they
topped a little rise of ground they were overjoyed to see the
cabin lying before them, not a hundred yards distant.
 
Here Tarzan released them, and, pointing toward the little
building, vanished into the jungle beside them.
 
"Most remarkable, most remarkable!" gasped the professor.
"But you see, Mr. Philander, that I was quite right, as
usual; and but for your stubborn willfulness we should have
escaped a series of most humiliating, not to say dangerous
accidents.  Pray allow yourself to be guided by a more mature
and practical mind hereafter when in need of wise counsel."
 
Mr. Samuel T. Philander was too much relieved at the
happy outcome to their adventure to take umbrage at the
professor's cruel fling.  Instead he grasped his friend's
arm and hastened him forward in the direction of the cabin.
 
It was a much-relieved party of castaways that found itself
once more united.  Dawn discovered them still recounting
their various adventures and speculating upon the identity of
the strange guardian and protector they had found on this
savage shore.
 
Esmeralda was positive that it was none other than an
angel of the Lord, sent down especially to watch over them.
 
"Had you seen him devour the raw meat of the lion,
Esmeralda," laughed Clayton, "you would have thought
him a very material angel."
 
"There was nothing heavenly about his voice," said Jane
Porter, with a little shudder at recollection of the awful roar
which had followed the killing of the lioness.
 
"Nor did it precisely comport with my preconceived ideas
of the dignity of divine messengers," remarked Professor
Porter, "when the--ah--gentleman tied two highly respectable
and erudite scholars neck to neck and dragged them through
the jungle as though they had been cows."
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
eaten or slept since the previous morning, began to bestir
themselves to prepare food.
 
The mutineers of the Arrow had landed a small supply of
dried meats, canned soups and vegetables, crackers, flour, tea,
and coffee for the five they had marooned, and these were
hurriedly drawn upon to satisfy the craving of long-famished
appetites.
 
The next task was to make the cabin habitable, and to this
end it was decided to at once remove the gruesome relics of
the tragedy which had taken place there on some bygone day.
 
Professor Porter and Mr. Philander were deeply interested
in examining the skeletons.  The two larger, they stated, had
belonged to a male and female of one of the higher white races.
 
The smallest skeleton was given but passing attention, as its
location, in the crib, left no doubt as to its having been the
infant offspring of this unhappy couple.
 
As they were preparing the skeleton of the man for burial,
Clayton discovered a massive ring which had evidently encircled
the man's finger at the time of his death, for one of the
slender bones of the hand still lay within the golden bauble.
 
Picking it up to examine it, Clayton gave a cry of astonishment,
for the ring bore the crest of the house of Greystoke.
 
At the same time, Jane discovered the books in the cupboard,
and on opening the fly-leaf of one of them saw the
name, JOHN CLAYTON, LONDON.  In a second book which she
hurriedly examined was the single name, GREYSTOKE.
 
"Why, Mr. Clayton," she cried, "what does this mean?
Here are the names of some of your own people in these books."
 
"And here," he replied gravely, "is the great ring of the
house of Greystoke which has been lost since my uncle, John
Clayton, the former Lord Greystoke, disappeared, presumably
lost at sea."
 
"But how do you account for these things being here, in
this savage African jungle?" exclaimed the girl.
 
"There is but one way to account for it, Miss Porter," said
Clayton.  "The late Lord Greystoke was not drowned.  He
died here in this cabin and this poor thing upon the floor is
all that is mortal of him."
 
"Then this must have been Lady Greystoke," said Jane
reverently, indicating the poor mass of bones upon the bed.
 
"The beautiful Lady Alice," replied Clayton, "of whose many
virtues and remarkable personal charms I often have heard
my mother and father speak.  Poor woman," he murmured sadly.
 
With deep reverence and solemnity the bodies of the late
Lord and Lady Greystoke were buried beside their little
African cabin, and between them was placed the tiny skeleton
of the baby of Kala, the ape.
 
As Mr. Philander was placing the frail bones of the infant
in a bit of sail cloth, he examined the skull minutely.  Then he
called Professor Porter to his side, and the two argued in low
tones for several minutes.
 
"Most remarkable, most remarkable," said Professor Porter.
 
"Bless me," said Mr. Philander, "we must acquaint Mr.
Clayton with our discovery at once."
 
"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander, tut, tut!" remonstrated Professor
Archimedes Q. Porter.  "`Let the dead past bury its dead.'"
 
And so the white-haired old man repeated the burial service
over this strange grave, while his four companions stood
with bowed and uncovered heads about him.
 
From the trees Tarzan of the Apes watched the solemn
ceremony; but most of all he watched the sweet face and
graceful figure of Jane Porter.
 
In his savage, untutored breast new emotions were stirring.
He could not fathom them.  He wondered why he felt so
great an interest in these people--why he had gone to such
pains to save the three men.  But he did not wonder why he
had torn Sabor from the tender flesh of the strange girl.
 
Surely the men were stupid and ridiculous and cowardly.
Even Manu, the monkey, was more intelligent than they.  If
these were creatures of his own kind he was doubtful if his
past pride in blood was warranted.
 
But the girl, ah--that was a different matter.  He did not
reason here.  He knew that she was created to be protected,
and that he was created to protect her.
 
He wondered why they had dug a great hole in the ground
merely to bury dry bones.  Surely there was no sense in that;
no one wanted to steal dry bones.
 
Had there been meat upon them he could have understood,
for thus alone might one keep his meat from Dango, the
hyena, and the other robbers of the jungle.
 
When the grave had been filled with earth the little party
turned back toward the cabin, and Esmeralda, still weeping
copiously for the two she had never heard of before today,
and who had been dead twenty years, chanced to glance toward
the harbor.  Instantly her tears ceased.
 
"Look at them low down white trash out there!" she shrilled,
pointing toward the Arrow.  "They-all's a desecrating
us, right here on this here perverted island."
 
And, sure enough, the Arrow was being worked toward the
open sea, slowly, through the harbor's entrance.
 
"They promised to leave us firearms and ammunition,"
said Clayton.  "The merciless beasts!"
 
"It is the work of that fellow they call Snipes, I am sure,"
said Jane.  "King was a scoundrel, but he had a little sense of
humanity.  If they had not killed him I know that he would
have seen that we were properly provided for before they left
us to our fate."
 
"I regret that they did not visit us before sailing," said
Professor Porter.  "I had proposed requesting them to leave the
treasure with us, as I shall be a ruined man if that is lost."
 
Jane looked at her father sadly.
 
"Never mind, dear," she said.  "It wouldn't have done any
good, because it is solely for the treasure that they killed
their officers and landed us upon this awful shore."
 
"Tut, tut, child, tut, tut!" replied Professor Porter.  "You
are a good child, but inexperienced in practical matters," and
Professor Porter turned and walked slowly away toward the
jungle, his hands clasped beneath his long coat tails and his
eyes bent upon the ground.
 
His daughter watched him with a pathetic smile upon her
lips, and then turning to Mr. Philander, she whispered:
 
"Please don't let him wander off again as he did yesterday.
We depend upon you, you know, to keep a close watch upon him."
 
"He becomes more difficult to handle each day," replied Mr.
Philander, with a sigh and a shake of his head.  "I presume
he is now off to report to the directors of the Zoo that
one of their lions was at large last night.  Oh, Miss Jane, you
don't know what I have to contend with."
 
"Yes, I do, Mr. Philander; but while we all love him, you
alone are best fitted to manage him; for, regardless of what
he may say to you, he respects your great learning, and,
therefore, has immense confidence in your judgment.  The
poor dear cannot differentiate between erudition and wisdom."
 
Mr. Philander, with a mildly puzzled expression on his
face, turned to pursue Professor Porter, and in his mind he
was revolving the question of whether he should feel
complimented or aggrieved at Miss Porter's rather
backhanded compliment.
 
Tarzan had seen the consternation depicted upon the faces
of the little group as they witnessed the departure of the
Arrow; so, as the ship was a wonderful novelty to him in
addition, he determined to hasten out to the point of land at the
north of the harbor's mouth and obtain a nearer view of the
boat, as well as to learn, if possible, the direction of its flight.
 
Swinging through the trees with great speed, he reached
the point only a moment after the ship had passed out of the
harbor, so that he obtained an excellent view of the wonders
of this strange, floating house.
 
There were some twenty men running hither and thither
about the deck, pulling and hauling on ropes.
 
A light land breeze was blowing, and the ship had been
worked through the harbor's mouth under scant sail, but now that
they had cleared the point every available shred of canvas was
being spread that she might stand out to sea as handily as possible.
 
Tarzan watched the graceful movements of the ship in rapt
admiration, and longed to be aboard her.  Presently his keen
eyes caught the faintest suspicion of smoke on the far northern
horizon, and he wondered over the cause of such a thing
out on the great water.
 
About the same time the look-out on the Arrow must have
discerned it, for in a few minutes Tarzan saw the sails being
shifted and shortened.  The ship came about, and presently he
knew that she was beating back toward land.
 
A man at the bows was constantly heaving into the sea a
rope to the end of which a small object was fastened.  Tarzan
wondered what the purpose of this action might be.
 
At last the ship came up directly into the wind; the anchor
was lowered; down came the sails.  There was great scurrying
about on deck.
 
A boat was lowered, and in it a great chest was placed.
Then a dozen sailors bent to the oars and pulled rapidly
toward the point where Tarzan crouched in the branches of a tree.
 
In the stern of the boat, as it drew nearer, Tarzan saw the
rat-faced man.
 
It was but a few minutes later that the boat touched the
beach.  The men jumped out and lifted the great chest to the
sand.  They were on the north side of the point so that their
presence was concealed from those at the cabin.
 
The men argued angrily for a moment.  Then the rat-faced
one, with several companions, ascended the low bluff on
which stood the tree that concealed Tarzan.  They looked
about for several minutes.
 
"Here is a good place," said the rat-faced sailor, indicating
a spot beneath Tarzan's tree.
 
"It is as good as any," replied one of his companions.
"If they catch us with the treasure aboard it will all be
confiscated anyway.  We might as well bury it here on the
chance that some of us will escape the gallows to come
back and enjoy it later."
 
The rat-faced one now called to the men who had remained
at the boat, and they came slowly up the bank carrying
picks and shovels.
 
"Hurry, you!" cried Snipes.
 
"Stow it!" retorted one of the men, in a surly tone.  "You're
no admiral, you damned shrimp."
 
"I'm Cap'n here, though, I'll have you to understand, you
swab," shrieked Snipes, with a volley of frightful oaths.
 
"Steady, boys," cautioned one of the men who had not
spoken before.  "It ain't goin' to get us nothing by fightin'
amongst ourselves."
 
"Right enough," replied the sailor who had resented
Snipes' autocratic tones; "but it ain't a-goin' to get nobody
nothin' to put on airs in this bloomin' company neither."
 
"You fellows dig here," said Snipes, indicating a spot beneath
the tree.  "And while you're diggin', Peter kin be a-makin'
of a map of the location so's we kin find it again.  You,
Tom, and Bill, take a couple more down and fetch up the chest."
 
"Wot are you a-goin' to do?" asked he of the previous
altercation.  "Just boss?"
 
"Git busy there," growled Snipes.  "You didn't think your
Cap'n was a-goin' to dig with a shovel, did you?"
 
The men all looked up angrily.  None of them liked Snipes,
and this disagreeable show of authority since he had
murdered King, the real head and ringleader of the mutineers,
had only added fuel to the flames of their hatred.
 
"Do you mean to say that you don't intend to take a shovel,
and lend a hand with this work?  Your shoulder's not hurt so
all-fired bad as that," said Tarrant, the sailor who had
before spoken.
 
"Not by a damned sight," replied Snipes, fingering the butt
of his revolver nervously.
 
"Then, by God," replied Tarrant, "if you won't take a
shovel you'll take a pickax."
 
With the words he raised his pick above his head, and, with
a mighty blow, he buried the point in Snipes' brain.
 
For a moment the men stood silently looking at the result
of their fellow's grim humor.  Then one of them spoke.
 
"Served the skunk jolly well right," he said.
 
One of the others commenced to ply his pick to the
ground.  The soil was soft and he threw aside the pick and
grasped a shovel; then the others joined him.  There was no
further comment on the killing, but the men worked in a better
frame of mind than they had since Snipes had assumed command.
 
When they had a trench of ample size to bury the chest,
Tarrant suggested that they enlarge it and inter Snipes' body
on top of the chest.
 
"It might 'elp fool any as 'appened to be diggin'
'ereabouts," he explained.
 
The others saw the cunning of the suggestion, and so the
trench was lengthened to accommodate the corpse, and in the
center a deeper hole was excavated for the box, which was
first wrapped in sailcloth and then lowered to its place, which
brought its top about a foot below the bottom of the grave.
Earth was shovelled in and tramped down about the chest
until the bottom of the grave showed level and uniform.
 
Two of the men rolled the rat-faced corpse unceremoniously
into the grave, after first stripping it of its weapons and
various other articles which the several members of the party
coveted for their own.
 
They then filled the grave with earth and tramped upon it
until it would hold no more.
 
The balance of the loose earth was thrown far and wide,
and a mass of dead undergrowth spread in as natural a manner
as possible over the new-made grave to obliterate all signs
of the ground having been disturbed.
 
Their work done the sailors returned to the small boat, and
pulled off rapidly toward the Arrow.
 
The breeze had increased considerably, and as the smoke
upon the horizon was now plainly discernible in considerable
volume, the mutineers lost no time in getting under full sail
and bearing away toward the southwest.
 
Tarzan, an interested spectator of all that had taken place, sat
speculating on the strange actions of these peculiar creatures.
 
Men were indeed more foolish and more cruel than the
beasts of the jungle!  How fortunate was he who lived in the
peace and security of the great forest!
 
Tarzan wondered what the chest they had buried contained.
If they did not want it why did they not merely throw
it into the water?  That would have been much easier.
 
Ah, he thought, but they do want it.  They have hidden it
here because they intend returning for it later.
 
Tarzan dropped to the ground and commenced to examine
the earth about the excavation.  He was looking to see if these
creatures had dropped anything which he might like to own.
Soon he discovered a spade hidden by the underbrush which
they had laid upon the grave.
 
He seized it and attempted to use it as he had seen the sailors
do.  It was awkward work and hurt his bare feet, but he
persevered until he had partially uncovered the body.  This he
dragged from the grave and laid to one side.
 
Then he continued digging until he had unearthed the chest.
This also he dragged to the side of the corpse.  Then he
filled in the smaller hole below the grave, replaced the body
and the earth around and above it, covered it over with
underbrush, and returned to the chest.
 
Four sailors had sweated beneath the burden of its weight
--Tarzan of the Apes picked it up as though it had been an
empty packing case, and with the spade slung to his back by a
piece of rope, carried it off into the densest part of the jungle.
 
He could not well negotiate the trees with his awkward burden,
but he kept to the trails, and so made fairly good time.
 
For several hours he traveled a little north of east until he
came to an impenetrable wall of matted and tangled vegetation.
Then he took to the lower branches, and in another fifteen
minutes he emerged into the amphitheater of the apes, where
they met in council, or to celebrate the rites of the Dum-Dum.
 
Near the center of the clearing, and not far from the
drum, or altar, he commenced to dig.  This was harder work
than turning up the freshly excavated earth at the grave, but
Tarzan of the Apes was persevering and so he kept at his
labor until he was rewarded by seeing a hole sufficiently deep
to receive the chest and effectually hide it from view.
 
Why had he gone to all this labor without knowing the
value of the contents of the chest?
 
Tarzan of the Apes had a man's figure and a man's brain,
but he was an ape by training and environment.  His brain
told him that the chest contained something valuable, or the
men would not have hidden it.  His training had taught him to
imitate whatever was new and unusual, and now the natural
curiosity, which is as common to men as to apes, prompted
him to open the chest and examine its contents.
 
But the heavy lock and massive iron bands baffled both his
cunning and his immense strength, so that he was compelled
to bury the chest without having his curiosity satisfied.
 
By the time Tarzan had hunted his way back to the vicinity
of the cabin, feeding as he went, it was quite dark.
 
Within the little building a light was burning, for Clayton
had found an unopened tin of oil which had stood intact for
twenty years, a part of the supplies left with the Claytons by
Black Michael.  The lamps also were still useable, and thus
the interior of the cabin appeared as bright as day to the
astonished Tarzan.
 
He had often wondered at the exact purpose of the lamps.
His reading and the pictures had told him what they were,
but he had no idea of how they could be made to produce
the wondrous sunlight that some of his pictures had
portrayed them as diffusing upon all surrounding objects.
 
As he approached the window nearest the door he saw that
the cabin had been divided into two rooms by a rough
partition of boughs and sailcloth.
 
In the front room were the three men; the two older deep
in argument, while the younger, tilted back against the wall
on an improvised stool, was deeply engrossed in reading one
of Tarzan's books.
 
Tarzan was not particularly interested in the men, however,
so he sought the other window.  There was the girl.  How
beautiful her features!  How delicate her snowy skin!
 
She was writing at Tarzan's own table beneath the window.
Upon a pile of grasses at the far side of the room lay the
Negress asleep.
 
For an hour Tarzan feasted his eyes upon her while she
wrote.  How he longed to speak to her, but he dared not
attempt it, for he was convinced that, like the young man, she
would not understand him, and he feared, too, that he might
frighten her away.
 
At length she arose, leaving her manuscript upon the table.
She went to the bed upon which had been spread several layers
of soft grasses.  These she rearranged.
 
Then she loosened the soft mass of golden hair which
crowned her head.  Like a shimmering waterfall turned to
burnished metal by a dying sun it fell about her oval face;
in waving lines, below her waist it tumbled.
 
Tarzan was spellbound.  Then she extinguished the lamp
and all within the cabin was wrapped in Cimmerian darkness.
 
Still Tarzan watched.  Creeping close beneath the window
he waited, listening, for half an hour.  At last he was
rewarded by the sounds of the regular breathing within which
denotes sleep.
 
Cautiously he intruded his hand between the meshes of the
lattice until his whole arm was within the cabin.  Carefully he
felt upon the desk.  At last he grasped the manuscript upon
which Jane Porter had been writing, and as cautiously withdrew
his arm and hand, holding the precious treasure.
 
Tarzan folded the sheets into a small parcel which he
tucked into the quiver with his arrows.  Then he melted away
into the jungle as softly and as noiselessly as a shadow.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
Early the following morning Tarzan awoke, and his first
thought of the new day, as the last of yesterday, was of
the wonderful writing which lay hidden in his quiver.
 
Hurriedly he brought it forth, hoping against hope that he
could read what the beautiful white girl had written there
the preceding evening.
 
At the first glance he suffered a bitter disappointment;
never before had he so yearned for anything as now he did
for the ability to interpret a message from that golden-haired
divinity who had come so suddenly and so unexpectedly into
his life.
 
What did it matter if the message were not intended for
him?  It was an expression of her thoughts, and that was
sufficient for Tarzan of the Apes.
 
And now to be baffled by strange, uncouth characters the
like of which he had never seen before!  Why, they even
tipped in the opposite direction from all that he had ever
examined either in printed books or the difficult script of
the few letters he had found.
 
Even the little bugs of the black book were familiar
friends, though their arrangement meant nothing to him; but
these bugs were new and unheard of.
 
For twenty minutes he pored over them, when suddenly
they commenced to take familiar though distorted shapes.
Ah, they were his old friends, but badly crippled.
 
Then he began to make out a word here and a word there.
His heart leaped for joy.  He could read it, and he would.
 
In another half hour he was progressing rapidly, and, but
for an exceptional word now and again, he found it very
plain sailing.
 
Here is what he read:
 
WEST COAST OF AFRICA, ABOUT 10X DEGREES SOUTH
      LATITUDE.  (So Mr. Clayton says.)
                  February 3 (?), 1909.
 
DEAREST HAZEL:
 
It seems foolish to write you a letter that you may never
see, but I simply must tell somebody of our awful experiences
since we sailed from Europe on the ill-fated Arrow.
 
If we never return to civilization, as now seems only too
likely, this will at least prove a brief record of the events
which led up to our final fate, whatever it may be.
 
As you know, we were supposed to have set out upon a
scientific expedition to the Congo.  Papa was presumed to
entertain some wondrous theory of an unthinkably ancient
civilization, the remains of which lay buried somewhere in the
Congo valley.  But after we were well under sail the truth
came out.
 
It seems that an old bookworm who has a book and curio
shop in Baltimore discovered between the leaves of a very old
Spanish manuscript a letter written in 1550 detailing the
adventures of a crew of mutineers of a Spanish galleon bound
from Spain to South America with a vast treasure of "doubloons"
and "pieces of eight," I suppose, for they certainly
sound weird and piraty.
 
The writer had been one of the crew, and the letter was to
his son, who was, at the very time the letter was written,
master of a Spanish merchantman.
 
Many years had elapsed since the events the letter narrated
had transpired, and the old man had become a respected citizen
of an obscure Spanish town, but the love of gold was still
so strong upon him that he risked all to acquaint his son with
the means of attaining fabulous wealth for them both.
 
The writer told how when but a week out from Spain the crew
had mutinied and murdered every officer and man who opposed
them; but they defeated their own ends by this very act, for
there was none left competent to navigate a ship at sea.
 
They were blown hither and thither for two months, until
sick and dying of scurvy, starvation, and thirst, they had
been wrecked on a small islet.
 
The galleon was washed high upon the beach where she
went to pieces; but not before the survivors, who numbered
but ten souls, had rescued one of the great chests of treasure.
 
This they buried well up on the island, and for three years
they lived there in constant hope of being rescued.
 
One by one they sickened and died, until only one man
was left, the writer of the letter.
 
The men had built a boat from the wreckage of the galleon,
but having no idea where the island was located they
had not dared to put to sea.
 
When all were dead except himself, however, the awful
loneliness so weighed upon the mind of the sole survivor that
he could endure it no longer, and choosing to risk death upon
the open sea rather than madness on the lonely isle, he set
sail in his little boat after nearly a year of solitude.
 
Fortunately he sailed due north, and within a week was in
the track of the Spanish merchantmen plying between the
West Indies and Spain, and was picked up by one of these
vessels homeward bound.
 
The story he told was merely one of shipwreck in which all
but a few had perished, the balance, except himself, dying
after they reached the island.  He did not mention the mutiny
or the chest of buried treasure.
 
The master of the merchantman assured him that from the
position at which they had picked him up, and the prevailing
winds for the past week he could have been on no other island
than one of the Cape Verde group, which lie off the
West Coast of Africa in about 16x or 17x north latitude.
 
His letter described the island minutely, as well as the
location of the treasure, and was accompanied by the crudest,
funniest little old map you ever saw; with trees and rocks all
marked by scrawly X's to show the exact spot where the
treasure had been buried.
 
When papa explained the real nature of the expedition, my
heart sank, for I know so well how visionary and impractical
the poor dear has always been that I feared that he had again
been duped; especially when he told me he had paid a thousand
dollars for the letter and map.
 
To add to my distress, I learned that he had borrowed ten
thousand dollars more from Robert Canler, and had given his
notes for the amount.
 
Mr. Canler had asked for no security, and you know,
dearie, what that will mean for me if papa cannot meet
them.  Oh, how I detest that man!
 
We all tried to look on the bright side of things, but Mr.
Philander, and Mr. Clayton--he joined us in London just for
the adventure--both felt as skeptical as I.
 
Well, to make a long story short, we found the island and
the treasure--a great iron-bound oak chest, wrapped in many
layers of oiled sailcloth, and as strong and firm as when it
had been buried nearly two hundred years ago.
 
It was SIMPLY FILLED with gold coin, and was so heavy that
four men bent underneath its weight.
 
The horrid thing seems to bring nothing but murder and
misfortune to those who have anything to do with it, for
three days after we sailed from the Cape Verde Islands our
own crew mutinied and killed every one of their officers.
 
Oh, it was the most terrifying experience one could
imagine--I cannot even write of it.
 
They were going to kill us too, but one of them, the leader,
named King, would not let them, and so they sailed south
along the coast to a lonely spot where they found a good
harbor, and here they landed and have left us.
 
They sailed away with the treasure to-day, but Mr. Clayton
says they will meet with a fate similar to the mutineers of the
ancient galleon, because King, the only man aboard who
knew aught of navigation, was murdered on the beach by one
of the men the day we landed.
 
I wish you could know Mr. Clayton; he is the dearest fellow
imaginable, and unless I am mistaken he has fallen very
much in love with me.
 
He is the only son of Lord Greystoke, and some day will inherit
the title and estates.  In addition, he is wealthy in his own
right, but the fact that he is going to be an English Lord
makes me very sad--you know what my sentiments have always
been relative to American girls who married titled foreigners.
Oh, if he were only a plain American gentleman!
 
But it isn't his fault, poor fellow, and in everything except
birth he would do credit to my country, and that is the greatest
compliment I know how to pay any man.
 
We have had the most weird experiences since we were
landed here.  Papa and Mr. Philander lost in the jungle,
and chased by a real lion.
 
Mr. Clayton lost, and attacked twice by wild beasts.
Esmeralda and I cornered in an old cabin by a perfectly awful
man-eating lioness.  Oh, it was simply "terrifical," as Esmeralda
would say.
 
But the strangest part of it all is the wonderful creature
who rescued us.  I have not seen him, but Mr. Clayton and
papa and Mr. Philander have, and they say that he is a
perfectly god-like white man tanned to a dusky brown, with the
strength of a wild elephant, the agility of a monkey, and the
bravery of a lion.
 
He speaks no English and vanishes as quickly and as
mysteriously after he has performed some valorous deed, as
though he were a disembodied spirit.
 
Then we have another weird neighbor, who printed a
beautiful sign in English and tacked it on the door of his
cabin, which we have preempted, warning us to destroy none
of his belongings, and signing himself "Tarzan of the Apes."
 
We have never seen him, though we think he is about, for
one of the sailors, who was going to shoot Mr. Clayton in the
back, received a spear in his shoulder from some unseen
hand in the jungle.
 
The sailors left us but a meager supply of food, so, as we
have only a single revolver with but three cartridges left in it,
we do not know how we can procure meat, though Mr. Philander
says that we can exist indefinitely on the wild fruit and
nuts which abound in the jungle.
 
I am very tired now, so I shall go to my funny bed of
grasses which Mr. Clayton gathered for me, but will add to
this from day to day as things happen.
                              Lovingly,
                                  JANE PORTER.
 
TO HAZEL STRONG, BALTIMORE, MD.
 
 
Tarzan sat in a brown study for a long time after he finished
reading the letter.  It was filled with so many new and
wonderful things that his brain was in a whirl as he attempted
to digest them all.
 
So they did not know that he was Tarzan of the Apes.  He
would tell them.
 
In his tree he had constructed a rude shelter of leaves and
boughs, beneath which, protected from the rain, he had
placed the few treasures brought from the cabin.  Among
these were some pencils.
 
He took one, and beneath Jane Porter's signature he wrote:
 
      I am Tarzan of the Apes
 
 
He thought that would be sufficient.  Later he would return
the letter to the cabin.
 
In the matter of food, thought Tarzan, they had no need to
worry--he would provide, and he did.
 
The next morning Jane found her missing letter in the
exact spot from which it had disappeared two nights before.
She was mystified; but when she saw the printed words beneath
her signature, she felt a cold, clammy chill run up her
spine.  She showed the letter, or rather the last sheet
with the signature, to Clayton.
 
"And to think," she said, "that uncanny thing was probably
watching me all the time that I was writing--oo!  It makes me
shudder just to think of it."
 
"But he must be friendly," reassured Clayton, "for he has
returned your letter, nor did he offer to harm you, and unless
I am mistaken he left a very substantial memento of his
friendship outside the cabin door last night, for I just found
the carcass of a wild boar there as I came out."
 
From then on scarcely a day passed that did not bring its
offering of game or other food.  Sometimes it was a young
deer, again a quantity of strange, cooked food--cassava
cakes pilfered from the village of Mbonga--or a boar, or
leopard, and once a lion.
 
Tarzan derived the greatest pleasure of his life in hunting
meat for these strangers.  It seemed to him that no pleasure
on earth could compare with laboring for the welfare and
protection of the beautiful white girl.
 
Some day he would venture into the camp in daylight and
talk with these people through the medium of the little bugs
which were familiar to them and to Tarzan.
 
But he found it difficult to overcome the timidity of the
wild thing of the forest, and so day followed day without
seeing a fulfillment of his good intentions.
 
The party in the camp, emboldened by familiarity, wandered
farther and yet farther into the jungle in search of nuts
and fruit.
 
Scarcely a day passed that did not find Professor Porter
straying in his preoccupied indifference toward the jaws of
death.  Mr. Samuel T. Philander, never what one might call
robust, was worn to the shadow of a shadow through the
ceaseless worry and mental distraction resultant from his
Herculean efforts to safeguard the professor.
 
A month passed.  Tarzan had finally determined to visit the
camp by daylight.
 
It was early afternoon.  Clayton had wandered to the point
at the harbor's mouth to look for passing vessels.  Here he
kept a great mass of wood, high piled, ready to be ignited as
a signal should a steamer or a sail top the far horizon.
 
Professor Porter was wandering along the beach south of
the camp with Mr. Philander at his elbow, urging him to turn
his steps back before the two became again the sport of some
savage beast.
 
The others gone, Jane and Esmeralda had wandered into the
jungle to gather fruit, and in their search were led farther
and farther from the cabin.
 
Tarzan waited in silence before the door of the little house
until they should return.  His thoughts were of the beautiful
white girl.  They were always of her now.  He wondered if she
would fear him, and the thought all but caused him to relinquish
his plan.
 
He was rapidly becoming impatient for her return, that he
might feast his eyes upon her and be near her, perhaps touch
her.  The ape-man knew no god, but he was as near to
worshipping his divinity as mortal man ever comes to worship.
While he waited he passed the time printing a message to
her; whether he intended giving it to her he himself could not
have told, but he took infinite pleasure in seeing his thoughts
expressed in print--in which he was not so uncivilized after
all.  He wrote:
 
 
I am Tarzan of the Apes.  I want you.  I am yours.  You are
mine.  We live here together always in my house.  I will bring
you the best of fruits, the tenderest deer, the finest meats that
roam the jungle.  I will hunt for you.  I am the greatest of the
jungle fighters.  I will fight for you.  I am the mightiest of the
jungle fighters.  You are Jane Porter, I saw it in your letter.
When you see this you will know that it is for you and that
Tarzan of the Apes loves you.
 
 
As he stood, straight as a young Indian, by the door, waiting
after he had finished the message, there came to his keen
ears a familiar sound.  It was the passing of a great ape
through the lower branches of the forest.
 
For an instant he listened intently, and then from the jungle
came the agonized scream of a woman, and Tarzan of the
Apes, dropping his first love letter upon the ground, shot like
a panther into the forest.
 
Clayton, also, heard the scream, and Professor Porter and
Mr. Philander, and in a few minutes they came panting to
the cabin, calling out to each other a volley of excited
questions as they approached.  A glance within confirmed
their worst fears.
 
Jane and Esmeralda were not there.
 
Instantly, Clayton, followed by the two old men, plunged
into the jungle, calling the girl's name aloud.  For half an
hour they stumbled on, until Clayton, by merest chance,
came upon the prostrate form of Esmeralda.
 
He stopped beside her, feeling for her pulse and then
listening for her heartbeats.  She lived.  He shook her.
 
"Esmeralda!" he shrieked in her ear.  "Esmeralda!  For God's
sake, where is Miss Porter?  What has happened?  Esmeralda!"
 
Slowly Esmeralda opened her eyes.  She saw Clayton.  She
saw the jungle about her.
 
"Oh, Gaberelle!" she screamed, and fainted again.
 
By this time Professor Porter and Mr. Philander had come up.
 
"What shall we do, Mr. Clayton?" asked the old professor.
"Where shall we look?  God could not have been so cruel as
to take my little girl away from me now."
 
"We must arouse Esmeralda first," replied Clayton.  "She
can tell us what has happened.  Esmeralda!" he cried again,
shaking the black woman roughly by the shoulder.
 
"O Gaberelle, I want to die!" cried the poor woman, but
with eyes fast closed.  "Let me die, dear Lord, don't let
me see that awful face again."
 
"Come, come, Esmeralda," cried Clayton.
 
"The Lord isn't here; it's Mr. Clayton.  Open your eyes."
 
Esmeralda did as she was bade.
 
"O Gaberelle!  Thank the Lord," she said.
 
"Where's Miss Porter?  What happened?" questioned Clayton.
 
"Ain't Miss Jane here?" cried Esmeralda, sitting up with
wonderful celerity for one of her bulk.  "Oh, Lord, now I
remember!  It must have took her away," and the Negress
commenced to sob, and wail her lamentations.
 
"What took her away?" cried Professor Porter.
 
"A great big giant all covered with hair."
 
"A gorilla, Esmeralda?" questioned Mr. Philander, and the
three men scarcely breathed as he voiced the horrible thought.
 
"I thought it was the devil; but I guess it must have been
one of them gorilephants.  Oh, my poor baby, my poor little
honey," and again Esmeralda broke into uncontrollable sobbing.
 
Clayton immediately began to look about for tracks, but he
could find nothing save a confusion of trampled grasses in
the close vicinity, and his woodcraft was too meager for the
translation of what he did see.
 
All the balance of the day they sought through the jungle;
but as night drew on they were forced to give up in despair
and hopelessness, for they did not even know in what
direction the thing had borne Jane.
 
It was long after dark ere they reached the cabin, and a sad
and grief-stricken party it was that sat silently within the
little structure.
 
Professor Porter finally broke the silence.  His tones were
no longer those of the erudite pedant theorizing upon the
abstract and the unknowable; but those of the man of action--
determined, but tinged also by a note of indescribable
hopelessness and grief which wrung an answering pang from
Clayton's heart.
 
"I shall lie down now," said the old man, "and try to sleep.
Early to-morrow, as soon as it is light, I shall take what food
I can carry and continue the search until I have found Jane.  I
will not return without her."
 
His companions did not reply at once.  Each was immersed
in his own sorrowful thoughts, and each knew, as did the old
professor, what the last words meant--Professor Porter
would never return from the jungle.
 
At length Clayton arose and laid his hand gently upon
Professor Porter's bent old shoulder.
 
"I shall go with you, of course," he said.
 
"I knew that you would offer--that you would wish to go,
Mr. Clayton; but you must not.  Jane is beyond human
assistance now.  What was once my dear little girl shall
not lie alone and friendless in the awful jungle.
 
"The same vines and leaves will cover us, the same rains beat
upon us; and when the spirit of her mother is abroad, it will
find us together in death, as it has always found us in life.
 
"No; it is I alone who may go, for she was my daughter--
all that was left on earth for me to love."
 
"I shall go with you," said Clayton simply.
 
The old man looked up, regarding the strong, handsome face
of William Cecil Clayton intently.  Perhaps he read there the
love that lay in the heart beneath--the love for his daughter.
 
He had been too preoccupied with his own scholarly
thoughts in the past to consider the little occurrences, the
chance words, which would have indicated to a more practical
man that these young people were being drawn more and
more closely to one another.  Now they came back to him,
one by one.
 
"As you wish," he said.
 
"You may count on me, also," said Mr. Philander.
 
"No, my dear old friend," said Professor Porter.  "We may not
all go.  It would be cruelly wicked to leave poor Esmeralda here
alone, and three of us would be no more successful than one.
 
"There be enough dead things in the cruel forest as it is.
Come--let us try to sleep a little."
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
From the time Tarzan left the tribe of great anthropoids in
which he had been raised, it was torn by continual strife
and discord.  Terkoz proved a cruel and capricious king, so
that, one by one, many of the older and weaker apes, upon whom
he was particularly prone to vent his brutish nature, took their
families and sought the quiet and safety of the far interior.
 
But at last those who remained were driven to desperation
by the continued truculence of Terkoz, and it so happened
that one of them recalled the parting admonition of Tarzan:
 
"If you have a chief who is cruel, do not do as the other
apes do, and attempt, any one of you, to pit yourself against
him alone.  But, instead, let two or three or four of you attack
him together.  Then, if you will do this, no chief will dare to
be other than he should be, for four of you can kill any chief
who may ever be over you."
 
And the ape who recalled this wise counsel repeated it to
several of his fellows, so that when Terkoz returned to the
tribe that day he found a warm reception awaiting him.
 
There were no formalities.  As Terkoz reached the group,
five huge, hairy beasts sprang upon him.
 
At heart he was an arrant coward, which is the way with
bullies among apes as well as among men; so he did not remain
to fight and die, but tore himself away from them as quickly
as he could and fled into the sheltering boughs of the forest.
 
Two more attempts he made to rejoin the tribe, but on
each occasion he was set upon and driven away.  At last he
gave it up, and turned, foaming with rage and hatred, into
the jungle.
 
For several days he wandered aimlessly, nursing his spite and
looking for some weak thing on which to vent his pent anger.
 
It was in this state of mind that the horrible, man-like
beast, swinging from tree to tree, came suddenly upon two
women in the jungle.
 
He was right above them when he discovered them.  The
first intimation Jane Porter had of his presence was when the
great hairy body dropped to the earth beside her, and she saw
the awful face and the snarling, hideous mouth thrust within
a foot of her.
 
One piercing scream escaped her lips as the brute hand
clutched her arm.  Then she was dragged toward those awful
fangs which yawned at her throat.  But ere they touched that
fair skin another mood claimed the anthropoid.
 
The tribe had kept his women.  He must find others to replace
them.  This hairless white ape would be the first of his new
household, and so he threw her roughly across his broad, hairy
shoulders and leaped back into the trees, bearing Jane away.
 
Esmeralda's scream of terror had mingled once with that
of Jane, and then, as was Esmeralda's manner under stress of
emergency which required presence of mind, she swooned.
 
But Jane did not once lose consciousness.  It is true that
that awful face, pressing close to hers, and the stench of the
foul breath beating upon her nostrils, paralyzed her with terror;
but her brain was clear, and she comprehended all that transpired.
 
With what seemed to her marvelous rapidity the brute bore her
through the forest, but still she did not cry out or struggle.
The sudden advent of the ape had confused her to such an extent
that she thought now that he was bearing her toward the beach.
 
For this reason she conserved her energies and her voice
until she could see that they had approached near enough to
the camp to attract the succor she craved.
 
She could not have known it, but she was being borne farther
and farther into the impenetrable jungle.
 
The scream that had brought Clayton and the two older
men stumbling through the undergrowth had led Tarzan of the
Apes straight to where Esmeralda lay, but it was not
Esmeralda in whom his interest centered, though pausing
over her he saw that she was unhurt.
 
For a moment he scrutinized the ground below and the
trees above, until the ape that was in him by virtue of
training and environment, combined with the intelligence that was
his by right of birth, told his wondrous woodcraft the whole
story as plainly as though he had seen the thing happen with
his own eyes.
 
And then he was gone again into the swaying trees, following
the high-flung spoor which no other human eye could
have detected, much less translated.
 
At boughs' ends, where the anthropoid swings from one tree
to another, there is most to mark the trail, but least to
point the direction of the quarry; for there the pressure is
downward always, toward the small end of the branch, whether
the ape be leaving or entering a tree.  Nearer the center of
the tree, where the signs of passage are fainter, the direction
is plainly marked.
 
Here, on this branch, a caterpillar has been crushed by the
fugitive's great foot, and Tarzan knows instinctively where
that same foot would touch in the next stride.  Here he looks
to find a tiny particle of the demolished larva, ofttimes not
more than a speck of moisture.
 
Again, a minute bit of bark has been upturned by the
scraping hand, and the direction of the break indicates the
direction of the passage.  Or some great limb, or the stem of the
tree itself has been brushed by the hairy body, and a tiny
shred of hair tells him by the direction from which it is
wedged beneath the bark that he is on the right trail.
 
Nor does he need to check his speed to catch these seemingly
faint records of the fleeing beast.
 
To Tarzan they stand out boldly against all the myriad
other scars and bruises and signs upon the leafy way.  But
strongest of all is the scent, for Tarzan is pursuing up the
wind, and his trained nostrils are as sensitive as a hound's.
 
There are those who believe that the lower orders are
specially endowed by nature with better olfactory nerves
than man, but it is merely a matter of development.
 
Man's survival does not hinge so greatly upon the perfection
of his senses.  His power to reason has relieved them of
many of their duties, and so they have, to some extent,
atrophied, as have the muscles which move the ears and scalp,
merely from disuse.
 
The muscles are there, about the ears and beneath the scalp,
and so are the nerves which transmit sensations to the brain,
but they are under-developed because they are not needed.
 
Not so with Tarzan of the Apes.  From early infancy his
survival had depended upon acuteness of eyesight, hearing,
smell, touch, and taste far more than upon the more slowly
developed organ of reason.
 
The least developed of all in Tarzan was the sense of taste,
for he could eat luscious fruits, or raw flesh, long buried
with almost equal appreciation; but in that he differed but
slightly from more civilized epicures.
 
Almost silently the ape-man sped on in the track of Terkoz
and his prey, but the sound of his approach reached the ears
of the fleeing beast and spurred it on to greater speed.
 
Three miles were covered before Tarzan overtook them, and
then Terkoz, seeing that further flight was futile, dropped
to the ground in a small open glade, that he might turn and
fight for his prize or be free to escape unhampered if he saw
that the pursuer was more than a match for him.
 
He still grasped Jane in one great arm as Tarzan bounded
like a leopard into the arena which nature had provided for
this primeval-like battle.
 
When Terkoz saw that it was Tarzan who pursued him, he
jumped to the conclusion that this was Tarzan's woman, since
they were of the same kind--white and hairless--and so he
rejoiced at this opportunity for double revenge upon his
hated enemy.
 
To Jane the strange apparition of this god-like man was as
wine to sick nerves.
 
From the description which Clayton and her father and
Mr. Philander had given her, she knew that it must be the
same wonderful creature who had saved them, and she saw in
him only a protector and a friend.
 
But as Terkoz pushed her roughly aside to meet Tarzan's
charge, and she saw the great proportions of the ape and the
mighty muscles and the fierce fangs, her heart quailed.  How
could any vanquish such a mighty antagonist?
 
Like two charging bulls they came together, and like two
wolves sought each other's throat.  Against the long canines of
the ape was pitted the thin blade of the man's knife.
 
Jane--her lithe, young form flattened against the trunk of
a great tree, her hands tight pressed against her rising and
falling bosom, and her eyes wide with mingled horror,
fascination, fear, and admiration--watched the primordial ape
battle with the primeval man for possession of a woman--for her.
 
As the great muscles of the man's back and shoulders knotted
beneath the tension of his efforts, and the huge biceps
and forearm held at bay those mighty tusks, the veil of
centuries of civilization and culture was swept from the
blurred vision of the Baltimore girl.
 
When the long knife drank deep a dozen times of Terkoz'
heart's blood, and the great carcass rolled lifeless upon
the ground, it was a primeval woman who sprang forward with
outstretched arms toward the primeval man who had fought
for her and won her.
 
And Tarzan?
 
He did what no red-blooded man needs lessons in doing.
He took his woman in his arms and smothered her upturned,
panting lips with kisses.
 
For a moment Jane lay there with half-closed eyes.  For a
moment--the first in her young life--she knew the meaning
of love.
 
But as suddenly as the veil had been withdrawn it dropped
again, and an outraged conscience suffused her face with its
scarlet mantle, and a mortified woman thrust Tarzan of the
Apes from her and buried her face in her hands.
 
Tarzan had been surprised when he had found the girl he had
learned to love after a vague and abstract manner a willing
prisoner in his arms.  Now he was surprised that she repulsed him.
 
He came close to her once more and took hold of her arm.
She turned upon him like a tigress, striking his great breast
with her tiny hands.
 
Tarzan could not understand it.
 
A moment ago and it had been his intention to hasten Jane
back to her people, but that little moment was lost now in the
dim and distant past of things which were but can never be again,
and with it the good intentions had gone to join the impossible.
 
Since then Tarzan of the Apes had felt a warm, lithe form
close pressed to his.  Hot, sweet breath against his cheek and
mouth had fanned a new flame to life within his breast, and
perfect lips had clung to his in burning kisses that had seared
a deep brand into his soul--a brand which marked a new Tarzan.
 
Again he laid his hand upon her arm.  Again she repulsed
him.  And then Tarzan of the Apes did just what his first
ancestor would have done.
 
He took his woman in his arms and carried her into the jungle.
 
Early the following morning the four within the little cabin
by the beach were awakened by the booming of a cannon.
Clayton was the first to rush out, and there, beyond the
harbor's mouth, he saw two vessels lying at anchor.
 
One was the Arrow and the other a small French cruiser.
The sides of the latter were crowded with men gazing shoreward,
and it was evident to Clayton, as to the others who had now
joined him, that the gun which they had heard had been fired
to attract their attention if they still remained at the cabin.
 
Both vessels lay at a considerable distance from shore, and
it was doubtful if their glasses would locate the waving hats
of the little party far in between the harbor's points.
 
Esmeralda had removed her red apron and was waving it
frantically above her head; but Clayton, still fearing that even
this might not be seen, hurried off toward the northern point
where lay his signal pyre ready for the match.
 
It seemed an age to him, as to those who waited breathlessly
behind, ere he reached the great pile of dry branches
and underbrush.
 
As he broke from the dense wood and came in sight of the
vessels again, he was filled with consternation to see that the
Arrow was making sail and that the cruiser was already
under way.
 
Quickly lighting the pyre in a dozen places, he hurried to
the extreme point of the promontory, where he stripped off
his shirt, and, tying it to a fallen branch, stood waving it back
and forth above him.
 
But still the vessels continued to stand out; and he had
given up all hope, when the great column of smoke, rising
above the forest in one dense vertical shaft, attracted the
attention of a lookout aboard the cruiser, and instantly a
dozen glasses were leveled on the beach.
 
Presently Clayton saw the two ships come about again; and
while the Arrow lay drifting quietly on the ocean, the
cruiser steamed slowly back toward shore.
 
At some distance away she stopped, and a boat was lowered
and dispatched toward the beach.
 
As it was drawn up a young officer stepped out.
 
"Monsieur Clayton, I presume?" he asked.
 
"Thank God, you have come!" was Clayton's reply.  "And
it may be that it is not too late even now."
 
"What do you mean, Monsieur?" asked the officer.
 
Clayton told of the abduction of Jane Porter and the need
of armed men to aid in the search for her.
 
"MON DIEU!" exclaimed the officer, sadly.  "Yesterday and
it would not have been too late.  Today and it may be better
that the poor lady were never found.  It is horrible, Monsieur.
It is too horrible."
 
Other boats had now put off from the cruiser, and Clayton,
having pointed out the harbor's entrance to the officer,
entered the boat with him and its nose was turned toward the
little landlocked bay, into which the other craft followed.
 
Soon the entire party had landed where stood Professor
Porter, Mr. Philander and the weeping Esmeralda.
 
Among the officers in the last boats to put off from the
cruiser was the commander of the vessel; and when he had
heard the story of Jane's abduction, he generously called
for volunteers to accompany Professor Porter and Clayton
in their search.
 
Not an officer or a man was there of those brave and
sympathetic Frenchmen who did not quickly beg leave to
be one of the expedition.
 
The commander selected twenty men and two officers,
Lieutenant D'Arnot and Lieutenant Charpentier.  A boat was
dispatched to the cruiser for provisions, ammunition, and
carbines; the men were already armed with revolvers.
 
Then, to Clayton's inquiries as to how they had happened
to anchor off shore and fire a signal gun, the commander,
Captain Dufranne, explained that a month before they had
sighted the Arrow bearing southwest under considerable
canvas, and that when they had signaled her to come about she
had but crowded on more sail.
 
They had kept her hull-up until sunset, firing several shots
after her, but the next morning she was nowhere to be seen.
They had then continued to cruise up and down the coast for
several weeks, and had about forgotten the incident of the
recent chase, when, early one morning a few days before the
lookout had described a vessel laboring in the trough of a
heavy sea and evidently entirely out of control.
 
As they steamed nearer to the derelict they were surprised
to note that it was the same vessel that had run from them a
few weeks earlier.  Her forestaysail and mizzen spanker were
set as though an effort had been made to hold her head up
into the wind, but the sheets had parted, and the sails were
tearing to ribbons in the half gale of wind.
 
In the high sea that was running it was a difficult and
dangerous task to attempt to put a prize crew aboard her; and as
no signs of life had been seen above deck, it was decided to
stand by until the wind and sea abated; but just then a figure
was seen clinging to the rail and feebly waving a mute signal
of despair toward them.
 
Immediately a boat's crew was ordered out and an attempt
was successfully made to board the Arrow.
 
The sight that met the Frenchmen's eyes as they clambered
over the ship's side was appalling.
 
A dozen dead and dying men rolled hither and thither upon
the pitching deck, the living intermingled with the dead.
Two of the corpses appeared to have been partially devoured
as though by wolves.
 
The prize crew soon had the vessel under proper sail once
more and the living members of the ill-starred company
carried below to their hammocks.
 
The dead were wrapped in tarpaulins and lashed on deck
to be identified by their comrades before being consigned to
the deep.
 
None of the living was conscious when the Frenchmen
reached the Arrow's deck.  Even the poor devil who had
waved the single despairing signal of distress had lapsed into
unconsciousness before he had learned whether it had availed
or not.
 
It did not take the French officer long to learn what had
caused the terrible condition aboard; for when water and
brandy were sought to restore the men, it was found that
there was none, nor even food of any description.
 
He immediately signalled to the cruiser to send water,
medicine, and provisions, and another boat made the perilous
trip to the Arrow.
 
When restoratives had been applied several of the men regained
consciousness, and then the whole story was told.  That part of
it we know up to the sailing of the Arrow after the murder
of Snipes, and the burial of his body above the treasure chest.
 
It seems that the pursuit by the cruiser had so terrorized
the mutineers that they had continued out across the Atlantic
for several days after losing her; but on discovering the
meager supply of water and provisions aboard, they had
turned back toward the east.
 
With no one on board who understood navigation, discussions
soon arose as to their whereabouts; and as three days'
sailing to the east did not raise land, they bore off to the
north, fearing that the high north winds that had prevailed
had driven them south of the southern extremity of Africa.
 
They kept on a north-northeasterly course for two days,
when they were overtaken by a calm which lasted for nearly
a week.  Their water was gone, and in another day they would
be without food.
 
Conditions changed rapidly from bad to worse.  One man
went mad and leaped overboard.  Soon another opened his
veins and drank his own blood.
 
When he died they threw him overboard also, though there
were those among them who wanted to keep the corpse on board.
Hunger was changing them from human beasts to wild beasts.
 
Two days before they had been picked up by the cruiser
they had become too weak to handle the vessel, and that
same day three men died.  On the following morning it was
seen that one of the corpses had been partially devoured.
 
All that day the men lay glaring at each other like beasts
of prey, and the following morning two of the corpses lay
almost entirely stripped of flesh.
 
The men were but little stronger for their ghoulish repast,
for the want of water was by far the greatest agony with
which they had to contend.  And then the cruiser had come.
 
When those who could had recovered, the entire story had
been told to the French commander; but the men were too
ignorant to be able to tell him at just what point on the coast
the professor and his party had been marooned, so the cruiser
had steamed slowly along within sight of land, firing occasional
signal guns and scanning every inch of the beach with glasses.
 
They had anchored by night so as not to neglect a particle
of the shore line, and it had happened that the preceding
night had brought them off the very beach where lay the
little camp they sought.
 
The signal guns of the afternoon before had not been
heard by those on shore, it was presumed, because they had
doubtless been in the thick of the jungle searching for Jane
Porter, where the noise of their own crashing through the
underbrush would have drowned the report of a far distant gun.
 
By the time the two parties had narrated their several
adventures, the cruiser's boat had returned with supplies
and arms for the expedition.
 
Within a few minutes the little body of sailors and the two
French officers, together with Professor Porter and Clayton,
set off upon their hopeless and ill-fated quest into the
untracked jungle.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
When Jane realized that she was being borne away a captive
by the strange forest creature who had rescued her from
the clutches of the ape she struggled desperately to escape,
but the strong arms that held her as easily as though she
had been but a day-old babe only pressed a little more tightly.
 
So presently she gave up the futile effort and lay quietly,
looking through half-closed lids at the faces of the man who
strode easily through the tangled undergrowth with her.
 
The face above her was one of extraordinary beauty.
 
A perfect type of the strongly masculine, unmarred by
dissipation, or brutal or degrading passions.  For, though Tarzan
of the Apes was a killer of men and of beasts, he killed as the
hunter kills, dispassionately, except on those rare occasions
when he had killed for hate--though not the brooding, malevolent
hate which marks the features of its own with hideous lines.
 
When Tarzan killed he more often smiled than scowled,
and smiles are the foundation of beauty.
 
One thing the girl had noticed particularly when she had
seen Tarzan rushing upon Terkoz--the vivid scarlet band
upon his forehead, from above the left eye to the scalp; but
now as she scanned his features she noticed that it was gone,
and only a thin white line marked the spot where it had been.
 
As she lay more quietly in his arms Tarzan slightly relaxed
his grip upon her.
 
Once he looked down into her eyes and smiled, and the
girl had to close her own to shut out the vision of that
handsome, winning face.
 
Presently Tarzan took to the trees, and Jane, wondering
that she felt no fear, began to realize that in many respects
she had never felt more secure in her whole life than now as
she lay in the arms of this strong, wild creature, being borne,
God alone knew where or to what fate, deeper and deeper
into the savage fastness of the untamed forest.
 
When, with closed eyes, she commenced to speculate upon
the future, and terrifying fears were conjured by a vivid
imagination, she had but to raise her lids and look upon that
noble face so close to hers to dissipate the last remnant of
apprehension.
 
No, he could never harm her; of that she was convinced
when she translated the fine features and the frank, brave
eyes above her into the chivalry which they proclaimed.
 
On and on they went through what seemed to Jane a solid
mass of verdure, yet ever there appeared to open before this
forest god a passage, as by magic, which closed behind them
as they passed.
 
Scarce a branch scraped against her, yet above and below,
before and behind, the view presented naught but a solid
mass of inextricably interwoven branches and creepers.
 
As Tarzan moved steadily onward his mind was occupied
with many strange and new thoughts.  Here was a problem
the like of which he had never encountered, and he felt
rather than reasoned that he must meet it as a man and not
as an ape.
 
The free movement through the middle terrace, which was the
route he had followed for the most part, had helped to cool
the ardor of the first fierce passion of his new found love.
 
Now he discovered himself speculating upon the fate
which would have fallen to the girl had he not rescued her
from Terkoz.
 
He knew why the ape had not killed her, and he commenced
to compare his intentions with those of Terkoz.
 
True, it was the order of the jungle for the male to take his
mate by force; but could Tarzan be guided by the laws of the
beasts?  Was not Tarzan a Man?  But what did men do?  He
was puzzled; for he did not know.
 
He wished that he might ask the girl, and then it came to
him that she had already answered him in the futile struggle
she had made to escape and to repulse him.
 
But now they had come to their destination, and Tarzan of
the Apes with Jane in his strong arms, swung lightly to the
turf of the arena where the great apes held their councils
and danced the wild orgy of the Dum-Dum.
 
Though they had come many miles, it was still but
midafternoon, and the amphitheater was bathed in the half
light which filtered through the maze of encircling foliage.
 
The green turf looked soft and cool and inviting.  The myriad
noises of the jungle seemed far distant and hushed to a
mere echo of blurred sounds, rising and falling like the surf
upon a remote shore.
 
A feeling of dreamy peacefulness stole over Jane as she
sank down upon the grass where Tarzan had placed her, and
as she looked up at his great figure towering above her, there
was added a strange sense of perfect security.
 
As she watched him from beneath half-closed lids, Tarzan
crossed the little circular clearing toward the trees upon the
further side.  She noted the graceful majesty of his carriage,
the perfect symmetry of his magnificent figure and the poise
of his well-shaped head upon his broad shoulders.
 
What a perfect creature!  There could be naught of cruelty
or baseness beneath that godlike exterior.  Never, she thought
had such a man strode the earth since God created the first in
his own image.
 
With a bound Tarzan sprang into the trees and disappeared.
Jane wondered where he had gone.  Had he left her
there to her fate in the lonely jungle?
 
She glanced nervously about.  Every vine and bush seemed but the
lurking-place of some huge and horrible beast waiting to bury
gleaming fangs into her soft flesh.  Every sound she magnified
into the stealthy creeping of a sinuous and malignant body.
 
How different now that he had left her!
 
For a few minutes that seemed hours to the frightened girl,
she sat with tense nerves waiting for the spring of the
crouching thing that was to end her misery of apprehension.
 
She almost prayed for the cruel teeth that would give her
unconsciousness and surcease from the agony of fear.
 
She heard a sudden, slight sound behind her.  With a cry
she sprang to her feet and turned to face her end.
 
There stood Tarzan, his arms filled with ripe and luscious fruit.
 
Jane reeled and would have fallen, had not Tarzan, dropping
his burden, caught her in his arms.  She did not lose
consciousness, but she clung tightly to him, shuddering and
trembling like a frightened deer.
 
Tarzan of the Apes stroked her soft hair and tried to comfort
and quiet her as Kala had him, when, as a little ape, he had
been frightened by Sabor, the lioness, or Histah, the snake.
 
Once he pressed his lips lightly upon her forehead, and she
did not move, but closed her eyes and sighed.
 
She could not analyze her feelings, nor did she wish to attempt
it.  She was satisfied to feel the safety of those strong
arms, and to leave her future to fate; for the last few hours
had taught her to trust this strange wild creature of the forest
as she would have trusted but few of the men of her acquaintance.
 
As she thought of the strangeness of it, there commenced
to dawn upon her the realization that she had, possibly,
learned something else which she had never really known
before--love.  She wondered and then she smiled.
 
And still smiling, she pushed Tarzan gently away; and
looking at him with a half-smiling, half-quizzical expression
that made her face wholly entrancing, she pointed to the fruit
upon the ground, and seated herself upon the edge of the
earthen drum of the anthropoids, for hunger was asserting itself.
 
Tarzan quickly gathered up the fruit, and, bringing it, laid
it at her feet; and then he, too, sat upon the drum beside her,
and with his knife opened and prepared the various fruits for
her meal.
 
Together and in silence they ate, occasionally stealing sly
glances at one another, until finally Jane broke into a merry
laugh in which Tarzan joined.
 
"I wish you spoke English," said the girl.
 
Tarzan shook his head, and an expression of wistful and
pathetic longing sobered his laughing eyes.
 
Then Jane tried speaking to him in French, and then in
German; but she had to laugh at her own blundering attempt
at the latter tongue.
 
"Anyway," she said to him in English, "you understand my
German as well as they did in Berlin."
 
Tarzan had long since reached a decision as to what his
future procedure should be.  He had had time to recollect all
that he had read of the ways of men and women in the books
at the cabin.  He would act as he imagined the men in the
books would have acted were they in his place.
 
Again he rose and went into the trees, but first he tried to
explain by means of signs that he would return shortly, and
he did so well that Jane understood and was not afraid when
he had gone.
 
Only a feeling of loneliness came over her and she watched
the point where he had disappeared, with longing eyes, awaiting
his return.  As before, she was appraised of his presence
by a soft sound behind her, and turned to see him coming
across the turf with a great armful of branches.
 
Then he went back again into the jungle and in a few minutes
reappeared with a quantity of soft grasses and ferns.
 
Two more trips he made until he had quite a pile of material
at hand.
 
Then he spread the ferns and grasses upon the ground in a
soft flat bed, and above it leaned many branches together so
that they met a few feet over its center.  Upon these he spread
layers of huge leaves of the great elephant's ear, and with
more branches and more leaves he closed one end of the little
shelter he had built.
 
Then they sat down together again upon the edge of the
drum and tried to talk by signs.
 
The magnificent diamond locket which hung about Tarzan's
neck, had been a source of much wonderment to Jane.
She pointed to it now, and Tarzan removed it and handed the
pretty bauble to her.
 
She saw that it was the work of a skilled artisan and that
the diamonds were of great brilliancy and superbly set, but
the cutting of them denoted that they were of a former day.
She noticed too that the locket opened, and, pressing the
hidden clasp, she saw the two halves spring apart to reveal in
either section an ivory miniature.
 
One was of a beautiful woman and the other might have
been a likeness of the man who sat beside her, except for a
subtle difference of expression that was scarcely definable.
 
She looked up at Tarzan to find him leaning toward her
gazing on the miniatures with an expression of astonishment.
He reached out his hand for the locket and took it away
from her, examining the likenesses within with unmistakable
signs of surprise and new interest.  His manner clearly
denoted that he had never before seen them, nor imagined that
the locket opened.
 
This fact caused Jane to indulge in further speculation, and
it taxed her imagination to picture how this beautiful ornament
came into the possession of a wild and savage creature
of the unexplored jungles of Africa.
 
Still more wonderful was how it contained the likeness of
one who might be a brother, or, more likely, the father of
this woodland demi-god who was even ignorant of the fact
that the locket opened.
 
Tarzan was still gazing with fixity at the two faces.
Presently he removed the quiver from his shoulder, and
emptying the arrows upon the ground reached into the bottom of
the bag-like receptacle and drew forth a flat object wrapped
in many soft leaves and tied with bits of long grass.
 
Carefully he unwrapped it, removing layer after layer of
leaves until at length he held a photograph in his hand.
 
Pointing to the miniature of the man within the locket he
handed the photograph to Jane, holding the open locket beside it.
 
The photograph only served to puzzle the girl still more, for
it was evidently another likeness of the same man whose picture
rested in the locket beside that of the beautiful young woman.
 
Tarzan was looking at her with an expression of puzzled
bewilderment in his eyes as she glanced up at him.  He
seemed to be framing a question with his lips.
 
The girl pointed to the photograph and then to the miniature
and then to him, as though to indicate that she thought
the likenesses were of him, but he only shook his head, and
then shrugging his great shoulders, he took the photograph
from her and having carefully rewrapped it, placed it again
in the bottom of his quiver.
 
For a few moments he sat in silence, his eyes bent upon
the ground, while Jane held the little locket in her hand,
turning it over and over in an endeavor to find some further
clue that might lead to the identity of its original owner.
 
At length a simple explanation occurred to her.
 
The locket had belonged to Lord Greystoke, and the
likenesses were of himself and Lady Alice.
 
This wild creature had simply found it in the cabin by the beach.
How stupid of her not to have thought of that solution before.
 
But to account for the strange likeness between Lord
Greystoke and this forest god--that was quite beyond her,
and it is not strange that she could not imagine that this
naked savage was indeed an English nobleman.
 
At length Tarzan looked up to watch the girl as she examined
the locket.  He could not fathom the meaning of the
faces within, but he could read the interest and fascination
upon the face of the live young creature by his side.
 
She noticed that he was watching her and thinking that he
wished his ornament again she held it out to him.  He took it
from her and taking the chain in his two hands he placed it
about her neck, smiling at her expression of surprise at his
unexpected gift.
 
Jane shook her head vehemently and would have removed the
golden links from about her throat, but Tarzan would not let
her.  Taking her hands in his, when she insisted upon it, he
held them tightly to prevent her.
 
At last she desisted and with a little laugh raised the locket
to her lips.
 
Tarzan did not know precisely what she meant, but he
guessed correctly that it was her way of acknowledging the
gift, and so he rose, and taking the locket in his hand,
stooped gravely like some courtier of old, and pressed his
lips upon it where hers had rested.
 
It was a stately and gallant little compliment performed
with the grace and dignity of utter unconsciousness of self.
It was the hall-mark of his aristocratic birth, the natural
outcropping of many generations of fine breeding, an hereditary
instinct of graciousness which a lifetime of uncouth and savage
training and environment could not eradicate.
 
It was growing dark now, and so they ate again of the fruit
which was both food and drink for them; then Tarzan rose,
and leading Jane to the little bower he had erected, motioned
her to go within.
 
For the first time in hours a feeling of fear swept over her,
and Tarzan felt her draw away as though shrinking from him.
 
Contact with this girl for half a day had left a very diferent
Tarzan from the one on whom the morning's sun had risen.
 
Now, in every fiber of his being, heredity spoke louder
than training.
 
He had not in one swift transition become a polished
gentleman from a savage ape-man, but at last the instincts
of the former predominated, and over all was the desire to
please the woman he loved, and to appear well in her eyes.
 
So Tarzan of the Apes did the only thing he knew to assure
Jane of her safety.  He removed his hunting knife from its
sheath and handed it to her hilt first, again motioning her
into the bower.
 
The girl understood, and taking the long knife she entered
and lay down upon the soft grasses while Tarzan of the Apes
stretched himself upon the ground across the entrance.
 
And thus the rising sun found them in the morning.
 
When Jane awoke, she did not at first recall the strange
events of the preceding day, and so she wondered at her odd
surroundings--the little leafy bower, the soft grasses of her
bed, the unfamiliar prospect from the opening at her feet.
 
Slowly the circumstances of her position crept one by one
into her mind.  And then a great wonderment arose in her
heart--a mighty wave of thankfulness and gratitude that
though she had been in such terrible danger, yet she was unharmed.
 
She moved to the entrance of the shelter to look for Tarzan.
He was gone; but this time no fear assailed her for she
knew that he would return.
 
In the grass at the entrance to her bower she saw the imprint
of his body where he had lain all night to guard her.
She knew that the fact that he had been there was all that
had permitted her to sleep in such peaceful security.
 
With him near, who could entertain fear?  She wondered if
there was another man on earth with whom a girl could feel
so safe in the heart of this savage African jungle.  Even the
lions and panthers had no fears for her now.
 
She looked up to see his lithe form drop softly from a
near-by tree.  As he caught her eyes upon him his face lighted
with that frank and radiant smile that had won her confidence
the day before.
 
As he approached her Jane's heart beat faster and her eyes
brightened as they had never done before at the approach of any man.
 
He had again been gathering fruit and this he laid at the
entrance of her bower.  Once more they sat down together to eat.
 
Jane commenced to wonder what his plans were.  Would he
take her back to the beach or would he keep her here?
Suddenly she realized that the matter did not seem to
give her much concern.  Could it be that she did not care!
 
She began to comprehend, also, that she was entirely contented
sitting here by the side of this smiling giant eating delicious
fruit in a sylvan paradise far within the remote depths of
an African jungle--that she was contented and very happy.
 
She could not understand it.  Her reason told her that she
should be torn by wild anxieties, weighted by dread fears,
cast down by gloomy forebodings; but instead, her heart was
singing and she was smiling into the answering face of the
man beside her.
 
When they had finished their breakfast Tarzan went to her
bower and recovered his knife.  The girl had entirely forgotten
it.  She realized that it was because she had forgotten the
fear that prompted her to accept it.
 
Motioning her to follow, Tarzan walked toward the trees
at the edge of the arena, and taking her in one strong arm
swung to the branches above.
 
The girl knew that he was taking her back to her people, and
she could not understand the sudden feeling of loneliness
and sorrow which crept over her.
 
For hours they swung slowly along.
 
Tarzan of the Apes did not hurry.  He tried to draw out the
sweet pleasure of that journey with those dear arms about his
neck as long as possible, and so he went far south of the direct
route to the beach.
 
Several times they halted for brief rests, which Tarzan did
not need, and at noon they stopped for an hour at a little
brook, where they quenched their thirst, and ate.
 
So it was nearly sunset when they came to the clearing, and
Tarzan, dropping to the ground beside a great tree, parted
the tall jungle grass and pointed out the little cabin to her.
 
She took him by the hand to lead him to it, that she might
tell her father that this man had saved her from death and
worse than death, that he had watched over her as carefully
as a mother might have done.
 
But again the timidity of the wild thing in the face of
human habitation swept over Tarzan of the Apes.  He drew
back, shaking his head.
 
The girl came close to him, looking up with pleading eyes.
Somehow she could not bear the thought of his going back
into the terrible jungle alone.
 
Still he shook his head, and finally he drew her to him very
gently and stooped to kiss her, but first he looked into her
eyes and waited to learn if she were pleased, or if she would
repulse him.
 
Just an instant the girl hesitated, and then she realized the
truth, and throwing her arms about his neck she drew his
face to hers and kissed him--unashamed.
 
"I love you--I love you," she murmured.
 
From far in the distance came the faint sound of many
guns.  Tarzan and Jane raised their heads.
 
From the cabin came Mr. Philander and Esmeralda.
 
From where Tarzan and the girl stood they could not see
the two vessels lying at anchor in the harbor.
 
Tarzan pointed toward the sounds, touched his breast and
pointed again.  She understood.  He was going, and something
told her that it was because he thought her people were in danger.
 
Again he kissed her.
 
"Come back to me," she whispered.  "I shall wait for you--always."
 
He was gone--and Jane turned to walk across the clearing
to the cabin.
 
Mr. Philander was the first to see her.  It was dusk and Mr.
Philander was very near sighted.
 
"Quickly, Esmeralda!" he cried.  "Let us seek safety within;
it is a lioness.  Bless me!"
 
Esmeralda did not bother to verify Mr. Philander's vision.
His tone was enough.  She was within the cabin and had
slammed and bolted the door before he had finished pronouncing
her name.  The "Bless me" was startled out of Mr. Philander
by the discovery that Esmeralda, in the exuberance
of her haste, had fastened him upon the same side of the
door as was the close-approaching lioness.
 
He beat furiously upon the heavy portal.
 
"Esmeralda!  Esmeralda!" he shrieked.  "Let me in.  I am
being devoured by a lion."
 
Esmeralda thought that the noise upon the door was made
by the lioness in her attempts to pursue her, so, after her
custom, she fainted.
 
Mr. Philander cast a frightened glance behind him.
 
Horrors!  The thing was quite close now.  He tried to
scramble up the side of the cabin, and succeeded in
catching a fleeting hold upon the thatched roof.
 
For a moment he hung there, clawing with his feet like a
cat on a clothesline, but presently a piece of the thatch came
away, and Mr. Philander, preceding it, was precipitated upon
his back.
 
At the instant he fell a remarkable item of natural history
leaped to his mind.  If one feigns death lions and lionesses are
supposed to ignore one, according to Mr. Philander's faulty memory.
 
So Mr. Philander lay as he had fallen, frozen into the horrid
semblance of death.  As his arms and legs had been extended
stiffly upward as he came to earth upon his back the
attitude of death was anything but impressive.
 
Jane had been watching his antics in mild-eyed surprise.
Now she laughed--a little choking gurgle of a laugh; but it
was enough.  Mr. Philander rolled over upon his side and
peered about.  At length he discovered her.
 
"Jane!" he cried.  "Jane Porter.  Bless me!"
 
He scrambled to his feet and rushed toward her.  He could
not believe that it was she, and alive.
 
"Bless me!"  Where did you come from?  Where in the world
have you been?  How--"
 
"Mercy, Mr. Philander," interrupted the girl, "I can never
remember so many questions."
 
"Well, well," said Mr. Philander.  "Bless me!  I am so filled
with surprise and exuberant delight at seeing you safe and
well again that I scarcely know what I am saying, really.  But
come, tell me all that has happened to you."
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
As the little expedition of sailors toiled through the dense
jungle searching for signs of Jane Porter, the futility of
their venture became more and more apparent, but the grief
of the old man and the hopeless eyes of the young Englishman
prevented the kind hearted D'Arnot from turning back.
 
He thought that there might be a bare possibility of finding
her body, or the remains of it, for he was positive that she
had been devoured by some beast of prey.  He deployed his
men into a skirmish line from the point where Esmeralda had
been found, and in this extended formation they pushed their
way, sweating and panting, through the tangled vines and
creepers.  It was slow work.  Noon found them but a few
miles inland.  They halted for a brief rest then, and after
pushing on for a short distance further one of the men
discovered a well-marked trail.
 
It was an old elephant track, and D'Arnot after consulting
with Professor Porter and Clayton decided to follow it.
 
The path wound through the jungle in a northeasterly
direction, and along it the column moved in single file.
 
Lieutenant D'Arnot was in the lead and moving at a quick
pace, for the trail was comparatively open.  Immediately
behind him came Professor Porter, but as he could not keep
pace with the younger man D'Arnot was a hundred yards in
advance when suddenly a half dozen black warriors arose
about him.
 
D'Arnot gave a warning shout to his column as the blacks
closed on him, but before he could draw his revolver he had
been pinioned and dragged into the jungle.
 
His cry had alarmed the sailors and a dozen of them
sprang forward past Professor Porter, running up the trail to
their officer's aid.
 
They did not know the cause of his outcry, only that it was
a warning of danger ahead.  They had rushed past the spot
where D'Arnot had been seized when a spear hurled from the
jungle transfixed one of the men, and then a volley of arrows
fell among them.
 
Raising their rifles they fired into the underbrush in the
direction from which the missiles had come.
 
By this time the balance of the party had come up, and
volley after volley was fired toward the concealed foe.  It was
these shots that Tarzan and Jane Porter had heard.
 
Lieutenant Charpentier, who had been bringing up the rear
of the column, now came running to the scene, and on hearing
the details of the ambush ordered the men to follow him,
and plunged into the tangled vegetation.
 
In an instant they were in a hand-to-hand fight with some
fifty black warriors of Mbonga's village.  Arrows and bullets
flew thick and fast.
 
Queer African knives and French gun butts mingled for a
moment in savage and bloody duels, but soon the natives fled
into the jungle, leaving the Frenchmen to count their losses.
 
Four of the twenty were dead, a dozen others were
wounded, and Lieutenant D'Arnot was missing.  Night was
falling rapidly, and their predicament was rendered doubly
worse when they could not even find the elephant trail which
they had been following.
 
There was but one thing to do, make camp where they
were until daylight.  Lieutenant Charpentier ordered a
clearing made and a circular abatis of underbrush constructed
about the camp.
 
This work was not completed until long after dark, the
men building a huge fire in the center of the clearing to give
them light to work by.
 
When all was safe as possible against attack of wild beasts
and savage men, Lieutenant Charpentier placed sentries
about the little camp and the tired and hungry men threw
themselves upon the ground to sleep.
 
The groans of the wounded, mingled with the roaring and
growling of the great beasts which the noise and firelight had
attracted, kept sleep, except in its most fitful form, from the
tired eyes.  It was a sad and hungry party that lay through the
long night praying for dawn.
 
The blacks who had seized D'Arnot had not waited to participate
in the fight which followed, but instead had dragged their
prisoner a little way through the jungle and then struck
the trail further on beyond the scene of the fighting in which
their fellows were engaged.
 
They hurried him along, the sounds of battle growing fainter
and fainter as they drew away from the contestants until there
suddenly broke upon D'Arnot's vision a good-sized clearing
at one end of which stood a thatched and palisaded village.
 
It was now dusk, but the watchers at the gate saw the
approaching trio and distinguished one as a prisoner ere they
reached the portals.
 
A cry went up within the palisade.  A great throng of
women and children rushed out to meet the party.
 
And then began for the French officer the most terrifying
experience which man can encounter upon earth--the reception
of a white prisoner into a village of African cannibals.
 
To add to the fiendishness of their cruel savagery was the
poignant memory of still crueler barbarities practiced upon
them and theirs by the white officers of that arch hypocrite,
Leopold II of Belgium, because of whose atrocities they had
fled the Congo Free State--a pitiful remnant of what once
had been a mighty tribe.
 
They fell upon D'Arnot tooth and nail, beating him with
sticks and stones and tearing at him with claw-like hands.
Every vestige of clothing was torn from him, and the merciless
blows fell upon his bare and quivering flesh.  But not
once did the Frenchman cry out in pain.  He breathed a silent
prayer that he be quickly delivered from his torture.
 
But the death he prayed for was not to be so easily had.
Soon the warriors beat the women away from their prisoner.
He was to be saved for nobler sport than this, and the first
wave of their passion having subsided they contented themselves
with crying out taunts and insults and spitting upon him.
 
Presently they reached the center of the village.  There
D'Arnot was bound securely to the great post from which no
live man had ever been released.
 
A number of the women scattered to their several huts to
fetch pots and water, while others built a row of fires on
which portions of the feast were to be boiled while the balance
would be slowly dried in strips for future use, as they
expected the other warriors to return with many prisoners.
The festivities were delayed awaiting the return of the warriors
who had remained to engage in the skirmish with the white men,
so that it was quite late when all were in the village,
and the dance of death commenced to circle around the
doomed officer.
 
Half fainting from pain and exhaustion, D'Arnot watched from
beneath half-closed lids what seemed but the vagary of delirium,
or some horrid nightmare from which he must soon awake.
 
The bestial faces, daubed with color--the huge mouths and
flabby hanging lips--the yellow teeth, sharp filed--the rolling,
demon eyes--the shining naked bodies--the cruel spears.
Surely no such creatures really existed upon earth--he must
indeed be dreaming.
 
The savage, whirling bodies circled nearer.  Now a spear
sprang forth and touched his arm.  The sharp pain and the
feel of hot, trickling blood assured him of the awful
reality of his hopeless position.
 
Another spear and then another touched him.  He closed
his eyes and held his teeth firm set--he would not cry out.
 
He was a soldier of France, and he would teach these
beasts how an officer and a gentleman died.
 
Tarzan of the Apes needed no interpreter to translate the
story of those distant shots.  With Jane Porter's kisses still
warm upon his lips he was swinging with incredible rapidity
through the forest trees straight toward the village of Mbonga.
 
He was not interested in the location of the encounter, for
he judged that that would soon be over.  Those who were
killed he could not aid, those who escaped would not need
his assistance.
 
It was to those who had neither been killed or escaped that
he hastened.  And he knew that he would find them by the
great post in the center of Mbonga village.
 
Many times had Tarzan seen Mbonga's black raiding parties
return from the northward with prisoners, and always
were the same scenes enacted about that grim stake,
beneath the flaring light of many fires.
 
He knew, too, that they seldom lost much time before
consummating the fiendish purpose of their captures.
He doubted that he would arrive in time to do more
than avenge.
 
On he sped.  Night had fallen and he traveled high along
the upper terrace where the gorgeous tropic moon lighted the
dizzy pathway through the gently undulating branches of the
tree tops.
 
Presently he caught the reflection of a distant blaze.  It lay
to the right of his path.  It must be the light from the camp
fire the two men had built before they were attacked--Tarzan
knew nothing of the presence of the sailors.
 
So sure was Tarzan of his jungle knowledge that he did not
turn from his course, but passed the glare at a distance of a
half mile.  It was the camp fire of the Frenchmen.
 
In a few minutes more Tarzan swung into the trees above
Mbonga's village.  Ah, he was not quite too late!  Or, was he?
He could not tell.  The figure at the stake was very still, yet
the black warriors were but pricking it.
 
Tarzan knew their customs.  The death blow had not been
struck.  He could tell almost to a minute how far the dance
had gone.
 
In another instant Mbonga's knife would sever one of the
victim's ears--that would mark the beginning of the end, for
very shortly after only a writhing mass of mutilated flesh
would remain.
 
There would still be life in it, but death then would be the
only charity it craved.
 
The stake stood forty feet from the nearest tree.  Tarzan
coiled his rope.  Then there rose suddenly above the fiendish
cries of the dancing demons the awful challenge of the ape-man.
 
The dancers halted as though turned to stone.
 
The rope sped with singing whir high above the heads of
the blacks.  It was quite invisible in the flaring lights
of the camp fires.
 
D'Arnot opened his eyes.  A huge black, standing directly before
him, lunged backward as though felled by an invisible hand.
 
Struggling and shrieking, his body, rolling from side to
side, moved quickly toward the shadows beneath the trees.
 
The blacks, their eyes protruding in horror, watched spellbound.
 
Once beneath the trees, the body rose straight into the air,
and as it disappeared into the foliage above, the terrified
negroes, screaming with fright, broke into a mad race for the
village gate.
 
D'Arnot was left alone.
 
He was a brave man, but he had felt the short hairs bristle
upon the nape of his neck when that uncanny cry rose upon
the air.
 
As the writhing body of the black soared, as though by
unearthly power, into the dense foliage of the forest, D'Arnot
felt an icy shiver run along his spine, as though death had
risen from a dark grave and laid a cold and clammy finger on
his flesh.
 
As D'Arnot watched the spot where the body had entered
the tree he heard the sounds of movement there.
 
The branches swayed as though under the weight of a
man's body--there was a crash and the black came sprawling
to earth again,--to lie very quietly where he had fallen.
 
Immediately after him came a white body, but this one
alighted erect.
 
D'Arnot saw a clean-limbed young giant emerge from the
shadows into the firelight and come quickly toward him.
 
What could it mean?  Who could it be?  Some new creature
of torture and destruction, doubtless.
 
D'Arnot waited.  His eyes never left the face of the advancing
man.  Nor did the other's frank, clear eyes waver beneath
D'Arnot's fixed gaze.
 
D'Arnot was reassured, but still without much hope,
though he felt that that face could not mask a cruel heart.
 
Without a word Tarzan of the Apes cut the bonds which
held the Frenchman.  Weak from suffering and loss of blood,
he would have fallen but for the strong arm that caught him.
 
He felt himself lifted from the ground.  There was a sensation
as of flying, and then he lost consciousness.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
When dawn broke upon the little camp of Frenchmen in the
heart of the jungle it found a sad and disheartened group.
 
As soon as it was light enough to see their surroundings
Lieutenant Charpentier sent men in groups of three in several
directions to locate the trail, and in ten minutes it was found
and the expedition was hurrying back toward the beach.
 
It was slow work, for they bore the bodies of six dead
men, two more having succumbed during the night, and several
of those who were wounded required support to move
even very slowly.
 
Charpentier had decided to return to camp for reinforcements,
and then make an attempt to track down the natives
and rescue D'Arnot.
 
It was late in the afternoon when the exhausted men
reached the clearing by the beach, but for two of them the
return brought so great a happiness that all their suffering
and heartbreaking grief was forgotten on the instant.
 
As the little party emerged from the jungle the first person
that Professor Porter and Cecil Clayton saw was Jane, standing
by the cabin door.
 
With a little cry of joy and relief she ran forward to greet
them, throwing her arms about her father's neck and bursting
into tears for the first time since they had been cast upon
this hideous and adventurous shore.
 
Professor Porter strove manfully to suppress his own emotions,
but the strain upon his nerves and weakened vitality
were too much for him, and at length, burying his old face in
the girl's shoulder, he sobbed quietly like a tired child.
 
Jane led him toward the cabin, and the Frenchmen turned
toward the beach from which several of their fellows were
advancing to meet them.
 
Clayton, wishing to leave father and daughter alone, joined the
sailors and remained talking with the officers until their boat
pulled away toward the cruiser whither Lieutenant Charpentier
was bound to report the unhappy outcome of his adventure.
 
Then Clayton turned back slowly toward the cabin.  His heart
was filled with happiness.  The woman he loved was safe.
 
He wondered by what manner of miracle she had been
spared.  To see her alive seemed almost unbelievable.
 
As he approached the cabin he saw Jane coming out.
When she saw him she hurried forward to meet him.
 
"Jane!" he cried, "God has been good to us, indeed.  Tell
me how you escaped--what form Providence took to save
you for--us."
 
He had never before called her by her given name.  Forty-eight
hours before it would have suffused Jane with a soft glow of
pleasure to have heard that name from Clayton's lips--now
it frightened her.
 
"Mr. Clayton," she said quietly, extending her hand, "first
let me thank you for your chivalrous loyalty to my dear father.
He has told me how noble and self-sacrificing you have
been.  How can we repay you!"
 
Clayton noticed that she did not return his familiar salutation,
but he felt no misgivings on that score.  She had been
through so much.  This was no time to force his love upon
her, he quickly realized.
 
"I am already repaid," he said.  "Just to see you and Professor
Porter both safe, well, and together again.  I do not
think that I could much longer have endured the pathos of
his quiet and uncomplaining grief.
 
"It was the saddest experience of my life, Miss Porter; and
then, added to it, there was my own grief--the greatest I
have ever known.  But his was so hopeless--his was pitiful.  It
taught me that no love, not even that of a man for his wife
may be so deep and terrible and self-sacrificing as the love of
a father for his daughter."
 
The girl bowed her head.  There was a question she wanted
to ask, but it seemed almost sacrilegious in the face of the
love of these two men and the terrible suffering they had
endured while she sat laughing and happy beside a godlike
creature of the forest, eating delicious fruits and looking
with eyes of love into answering eyes.
 
But love is a strange master, and human nature is still
stranger, so she asked her question.
 
"Where is the forest man who went to rescue you?  Why
did he not return?"
 
"I do not understand," said Clayton.  "Whom do you mean?"
 
"He who has saved each of us--who saved me from the gorilla."
 
"Oh," cried Clayton, in surprise.  "It was he who rescued you?
You have not told me anything of your adventure, you know."
 
"But the wood man," she urged.  "Have you not seen him?
When we heard the shots in the jungle, very faint and far
away, he left me.  We had just reached the clearing, and he
hurried off in the direction of the fighting.  I know he went
to aid you."
 
Her tone was almost pleading--her manner tense with suppressed
emotion.  Clayton could not but notice it, and he wondered,
vaguely, why she was so deeply moved--so anxious to
know the whereabouts of this strange creature.
 
Yet a feeling of apprehension of some impending sorrow
haunted him, and in his breast, unknown to himself, was
implanted the first germ of jealousy and suspicion of the
ape-man, to whom he owed his life.
 
"We did not see him," he replied quietly.  "He did not join
us."  And then after a moment of thoughtful pause:  "Possibly
he joined his own tribe--the men who attacked us."  He did
not know why he had said it, for he did not believe it.
 
The girl looked at him wide eyed for a moment.
 
"No!" she exclaimed vehemently, much too vehemently he
thought.  "It could not be.  They were savages."
 
Clayton looked puzzled.
 
"He is a strange, half-savage creature of the jungle, Miss
Porter.  We know nothing of him.  He neither speaks nor
understands any European tongue--and his ornaments and
weapons are those of the West Coast savages."
 
Clayton was speaking rapidly.
 
"There are no other human beings than savages within
hundreds of miles, Miss Porter.  He must belong to the tribes
which attacked us, or to some other equally savage--he may
even be a cannibal."
 
Jane blanched.
 
"I will not believe it," she half whispered.  "It is not true.
You shall see," she said, addressing Clayton, "that he will
come back and that he will prove that you are wrong.  You
do not know him as I do.  I tell you that he is a gentleman."
 
Clayton was a generous and chivalrous man, but something
in the girl's breathless defense of the forest man stirred him
to unreasoning jealousy, so that for the instant he forgot all
that they owed to this wild demi-god, and he answered her
with a half sneer upon his lip.
 
"Possibly you are right, Miss Porter," he said, "but I do
not think that any of us need worry about our carrion-eating
acquaintance.  The chances are that he is some half-demented
castaway who will forget us more quickly, but no more
surely, than we shall forget him.  He is only a beast of
the jungle, Miss Porter."
 
The girl did not answer, but she felt her heart shrivel
within her.
 
She knew that Clayton spoke merely what he thought, and
for the first time she began to analyze the structure which
supported her newfound love, and to subject its object to a
critical examination.
 
Slowly she turned and walked back to the cabin.  She tried
to imagine her wood-god by her side in the saloon of an
ocean liner.  She saw him eating with his hands, tearing his
food like a beast of prey, and wiping his greasy fingers upon
his thighs.  She shuddered.
 
She saw him as she introduced him to her friends--uncouth,
illiterate--a boor; and the girl winced.
 
She had reached her room now, and as she sat upon the
edge of her bed of ferns and grasses, with one hand resting
upon her rising and falling bosom, she felt the hard outlines
of the man's locket.
 
She drew it out, holding it in the palm of her hand for a
moment with tear-blurred eyes bent upon it.  Then she raised
it to her lips, and crushing it there buried her face in
the soft ferns, sobbing.
 
"Beast?" she murmured.  "Then God make me a beast; for,
man or beast, I am yours."
 
She did not see Clayton again that day.  Esmeralda brought
her supper to her, and she sent word to her father that she
was suffering from the reaction following her adventure.
 
The next morning Clayton left early with the relief expedition
in search of Lieutenant D'Arnot.  There were two hundred
armed men this time, with ten officers and two surgeons,
and provisions for a week.
 
They carried bedding and hammocks, the latter for transporting
their sick and wounded.
 
It was a determined and angry company--a punitive expedition
as well as one of relief.  They reached the sight of the
skirmish of the previous expedition shortly after noon, for
they were now traveling a known trail and no time was lost
in exploring.
 
From there on the elephant-track led straight to Mbonga's
village.  It was but two o'clock when the head of the column
halted upon the edge of the clearing.
 
Lieutenant Charpentier, who was in command, immediately
sent a portion of his force through the jungle to the opposite
side of the village.  Another detachment was dispatched
to a point before the village gate, while he remained with the
balance upon the south side of the clearing.
 
It was arranged that the party which was to take its position
to the north, and which would be the last to gain its station
should commence the assault, and that their opening volley
should be the signal for a concerted rush from all sides in an
attempt to carry the village by storm at the first charge.
 
For half an hour the men with Lieutenant Charpentier
crouched in the dense foliage of the jungle, waiting the
signal.  To them it seemed like hours.  They could see natives in
the fields, and others moving in and out of the village gate.
 
At length the signal came--a sharp rattle of musketry, and
like one man, an answering volley tore from the jungle to the
west and to the south.
 
The natives in the field dropped their implements and
broke madly for the palisade.  The French bullets mowed
them down, and the French sailors bounded over their
prostrate bodies straight for the village gate.
 
So sudden and unexpected the assault had been that the
whites reached the gates before the frightened natives could
bar them, and in another minute the village street was filled
with armed men fighting hand to hand in an inextricable tangle.
 
For a few moments the blacks held their ground within the
entrance to the street, but the revolvers, rifles and cutlasses
of the Frenchmen crumpled the native spearmen and struck
down the black archers with their bows halfdrawn.
 
Soon the battle turned to a wild rout, and then to a grim
massacre; for the French sailors had seen bits of D'Arnot's
uniform upon several of the black warriors who opposed them.
 
They spared the children and those of the women whom
they were not forced to kill in self-defense, but when at
length they stopped, parting, blood covered and sweating, it
was because there lived to oppose them no single warrior of
all the savage village of Mbonga.
 
Carefully they ransacked every hut and corner of the village,
but no sign of D'Arnot could they find.  They questioned
the prisoners by signs, and finally one of the sailors who had
served in the French Congo found that he could make them
understand the bastard tongue that passes for language between
the whites and the more degraded tribes of the coast,
but even then they could learn nothing definite regarding the
fate of D'Arnot.
 
Only excited gestures and expressions of fear could they
obtain in response to their inquiries concerning their fellow;
and at last they became convinced that these were but evidences
of the guilt of these demons who had slaughtered and
eaten their comrade two nights before.
 
At length all hope left them, and they prepared to camp
for the night within the village.  The prisoners were herded
into three huts where they were heavily guarded.  Sentries
were posted at the barred gates, and finally the village was
wrapped in the silence of slumber, except for the wailing of
the native women for their dead.
 
The next morning they set out upon the return march.
Their original intention had been to burn the village, but
this idea was abandoned and the prisoners were left behind,
weeping and moaning, but with roofs to cover them and a
palisade for refuge from the beasts of the jungle.
 
Slowly the expedition retraced its steps of the preceding
day.  Ten loaded hammocks retarded its pace.  In eight of
them lay the more seriously wounded, while two swung beneath
the weight of the dead.
 
Clayton and Lieutenant Charpentier brought up the rear of
the column; the Englishman silent in respect for the other's
grief, for D'Arnot and Charpentier had been inseparable
friends since boyhood.
 
Clayton could not but realize that the Frenchman felt his
grief the more keenly because D'Arnot's sacrifice had been so
futile, since Jane had been rescued before D'Arnot had fallen
into the hands of the savages, and again because the service
in which he had lost his life had been outside his duty and
for strangers and aliens; but when he spoke of it to Lieutenant
Charpentier, the latter shook his head.
 
"No, Monsieur," he said, "D'Arnot would have chosen to
die thus.  I only grieve that I could not have died for him, or
at least with him.  I wish that you could have known him better,
Monsieur.  He was indeed an officer and a gentleman--a
title conferred on many, but deserved by so few.
 
"He did not die futilely, for his death in the cause of a
strange American girl will make us, his comrades, face our
ends the more bravely, however they may come to us."
 
Clayton did not reply, but within him rose a new respect
for Frenchmen which remained undimmed ever after.
 
It was quite late when they reached the cabin by the beach.
A single shot before they emerged from the jungle had announced
to those in camp as well as on the ship that the expedition
had been too late--for it had been prearranged that
when they came within a mile or two of camp one shot was
to be fired to denote failure, or three for success, while two
would have indicated that they had found no sign of either
D'Arnot or his black captors.
 
So it was a solemn party that awaited their coming, and few
words were spoken as the dead and wounded men were tenderly
placed in boats and rowed silently toward the cruiser.
 
Clayton, exhausted from his five days of laborious marching
through the jungle and from the effects of his two battles
with the blacks, turned toward the cabin to seek a mouthful
of food and then the comparative ease of his bed of grasses
after two nights in the jungle.
 
By the cabin door stood Jane.
 
"The poor lieutenant?" she asked.  "Did you find no trace
of him?"
 
"We were too late, Miss Porter," he replied sadly.
 
"Tell me.  What had happened?" she asked.
 
"I cannot, Miss Porter, it is too horrible."
 
"You do not mean that they had tortured him?" she whispered.
 
"We do not know what they did to him BEFORE they killed
him," he answered, his face drawn with fatigue and the sorrow
he felt for poor D'Arnot and he emphasized the word before.
 
"BEFORE they killed him!  What do you mean?  They are
not--?  They are not--?"
 
She was thinking of what Clayton had said of the forest
man's probable relationship to this tribe and she could not
frame the awful word.
 
"Yes, Miss Porter, they were--cannibals," he said, almost
bitterly, for to him too had suddenly come the thought of the
forest man, and the strange, unaccountable jealousy he had
felt two days before swept over him once more.
 
And then in sudden brutality that was as unlike Clayton as
courteous consideration is unlike an ape, he blurted out:
 
"When your forest god left you he was doubtless hurrying
to the feast."
 
He was sorry ere the words were spoken though he did not
know how cruelly they had cut the girl.  His regret was for his
baseless disloyalty to one who had saved the lives of every
member of his party, and offered harm to none.
 
The girl's head went high.
 
"There could be but one suitable reply to your assertion,
Mr. Clayton," she said icily, "and I regret that I am not a
man, that I might make it."  She turned quickly and entered
the cabin.
 
Clayton was an Englishman, so the girl had passed quite out
of sight before he deduced what reply a man would have made.
 
"Upon my word," he said ruefully, "she called me a liar.
And I fancy I jolly well deserved it," he added thoughtfully.
"Clayton, my boy, I know you are tired out and unstrung,
but that's no reason why you should make an ass of yourself.
You'd better go to bed."
 
But before he did so he called gently to Jane upon the opposite
side of the sailcloth partition, for he wished to apologize,
but he might as well have addressed the Sphinx.  Then he wrote
upon a piece of paper and shoved it beneath the partition.
 
Jane saw the little note and ignored it, for she was very
angry and hurt and mortified, but--she was a woman, and so
eventually she picked it up and read it.
 
MY DEAR MISS PORTER:
 
I had no reason to insinuate what I did.  My only excuse is
that my nerves must be unstrung--which is no excuse at all.
 
Please try and think that I did not say it.  I am very sorry.  I
would not have hurt YOU, above all others in the world.  Say
that you forgive me.
              WM. CECIL CLAYTON.
 
 
"He did think it or he never would have said it," reasoned
the girl, "but it cannot be true--oh, I know it is not true!"
 
One sentence in the letter frightened her:  "I would not
have hurt YOU above all others in the world."
 
A week ago that sentence would have filled her with delight,
now it depressed her.
 
She wished she had never met Clayton.  She was sorry that
she had ever seen the forest god.  No, she was glad.  And there
was that other note she had found in the grass before the
cabin the day after her return from the jungle, the love note
signed by Tarzan of the Apes.
 
Who could be this new suitor?  If he were another of the
wild denizens of this terrible forest what might he not do to
claim her?
 
"Esmeralda!  Wake up," she cried.
 
"You make me so irritable, sleeping there peacefully when
you know perfectly well that the world is filled with sorrow."
 
"Gaberelle!" screamed Esmeralda, sitting up.  "What is it
now?  A hipponocerous?  Where is he, Miss Jane?"
 
"Nonsense, Esmeralda, there is nothing.  Go back to sleep.
You are bad enough asleep, but you are infinitely worse awake."
 
"Yes honey, but what's the matter with you, precious?  You
acts sort of disgranulated this evening."
 
"Oh, Esmeralda, I'm just plain ugly to-night," said the girl.
"Don't pay any attention to me--that's a dear."
 
"Yes, honey; now you go right to sleep.  Your nerves are
all on edge.  What with all these ripotamuses and man eating
geniuses that Mister Philander been telling about--Lord, it
ain't no wonder we all get nervous prosecution."
 
Jane crossed the little room, laughing, and kissing the
faithful woman, bid Esmeralda good night.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
When D'Arnot regained consciousness, he found himself
lying upon a bed of soft ferns and grasses beneath a
little "A" shaped shelter of boughs.
 
At his feet an opening looked out upon a green sward, and at a
little distance beyond was the dense wall of jungle and forest.
 
He was very lame and sore and weak, and as full consciousness
returned he felt the sharp torture of many cruel
wounds and the dull aching of every bone and muscle in his
body as a result of the hideous beating he had received.
 
Even the turning of his head caused him such excruciating
agony that he lay still with closed eyes for a long time.
 
He tried to piece out the details of his adventure prior to
the time he lost consciousness to see if they would explain his
present whereabouts--he wondered if he were among friends
or foes.
 
At length he recollected the whole hideous scene at the
stake, and finally recalled the strange white figure in whose
arms he had sunk into oblivion.
 
D'Arnot wondered what fate lay in store for him now.  He
could neither see nor hear any signs of life about him.
 
The incessant hum of the jungle--the rustling of millions
of leaves--the buzz of insects--the voices of the birds and
monkeys seemed blended into a strangely soothing purr, as
though he lay apart, far from the myriad life whose sounds
came to him only as a blurred echo.
 
At length he fell into a quiet slumber, nor did he awake
again until afternoon.
 
Once more he experienced the strange sense of utter
bewilderment that had marked his earlier awakening, but soon he
recalled the recent past, and looking through the opening at
his feet he saw the figure of a man squatting on his haunches.
 
The broad, muscular back was turned toward him, but,
tanned though it was, D'Arnot saw that it was the back of a
white man, and he thanked God.
 
The Frenchman called faintly.  The man turned, and rising,
came toward the shelter.  His face was very handsome--the
handsomest, thought D'Arnot, that he had ever seen.
 
Stooping, he crawled into the shelter beside the wounded
officer, and placed a cool hand upon his forehead.
 
D'Arnot spoke to him in French, but the man only shook
his head--sadly, it seemed to the Frenchman.
 
Then D'Arnot tried English, but still the man shook his head.
Italian, Spanish and German brought similar discouragement.
 
D'Arnot knew a few words of Norwegian, Russian, Greek,
and also had a smattering of the language of one of the
West Coast negro tribes--the man denied them all.
 
After examining D'Arnot's wounds the man left the shelter
and disappeared.  In half an hour he was back with fruit and
a hollow gourd-like vegetable filled with water.
 
D'Arnot drank and ate a little.  He was surprised that he
had no fever.  Again he tried to converse with his strange
nurse, but the attempt was useless.
 
Suddenly the man hastened from the shelter only to return
a few minutes later with several pieces of bark and--wonder
of wonders--a lead pencil.
 
Squatting beside D'Arnot he wrote for a minute on the
smooth inner surface of the bark; then he handed it to the
Frenchman.
 
D'Arnot was astonished to see, in plain print-like characters,
a message in English:
 
 
I am Tarzan of the Apes.  Who are you?  Can you read this
language?
 
 
D'Arnot seized the pencil--then he stopped.  This strange
man wrote English--evidently he was an Englishman.
 
"Yes," said D'Arnot, "I read English.  I speak it also.  Now
we may talk.  First let me thank you for all that you have
done for me."
 
The man only shook his head and pointed to the pencil
and the bark.
 
"MON DIEU!" cried D'Arnot.  "If you are English why is it
then that you cannot speak English?"
 
And then in a flash it came to him--the man was a mute,
possibly a deaf mute.
 
So D'Arnot wrote a message on the bark, in English.
 
 
I am Paul d'Arnot, Lieutenant in the navy of France.  I
thank you for what you have done for me.  You have saved
my life, and all that I have is yours.  May I ask how it
is that one who writes English does not speak it?
 
 
Tarzan's reply filled D'Arnot with still greater wonder:
 
 
I speak only the language of my tribe--the great apes who
were Kerchak's; and a little of the languages of Tantor, the
elephant, and Numa, the lion, and of the other folks of the
jungle I understand.  With a human being I have never spoken,
except once with Jane Porter, by signs.  This is the first time
I have spoken with another of my kind through written words.
 
 
D'Arnot was mystified.  It seemed incredible that there
lived upon earth a full-grown man who had never spoken
with a fellow man, and still more preposterous that such a
one could read and write.
 
He looked again at Tarzan's message--"except once, with
Jane Porter."  That was the American girl who had been
carried into the jungle by a gorilla.
 
A sudden light commenced to dawn on D'Arnot--this then
was the "gorilla."  He seized the pencil and wrote:
 
 
Where is Jane Porter?
 
 
And Tarzan replied, below:
 
 
Back with her people in the cabin of Tarzan of the Apes.
 
 
She is not dead then?  Where was she?  What happened to her?
 
 
She is not dead.  She was taken by Terkoz to be his wife;
but Tarzan of the Apes took her away from Terkoz and
killed him before he could harm her.
 
None in all the jungle may face Tarzan of the Apes in battle,
and live.  I am Tarzan of the Apes--mighty fighter.
 
D'Arnot wrote:
 
 
I am glad she is safe.  It pains me to write, I will rest a
while.
 
 
And then Tarzan:
 
 
Yes, rest.  When you are well I shall take you back to your people.
 
 
For many days D'Arnot lay upon his bed of soft ferns.
The second day a fever had come and D'Arnot thought that
it meant infection and he knew that he would die.
 
An idea came to him.  He wondered why he had not
thought of it before.
 
He called Tarzan and indicated by signs that he would
write, and when Tarzan had fetched the bark and pencil,
D'Arnot wrote:
 
 
Can you go to my people and lead them here?  I will write
a message that you may take to them, and they will follow you.
 
 
Tarzan shook his head and taking the bark, wrote:
 
 
I had thought of that--the first day; but I dared not.  The
great apes come often to this spot, and if they found you
here, wounded and alone, they would kill you.
 
 
D'Arnot turned on his side and closed his eyes.  He did not
wish to die; but he felt that he was going, for the fever was
mounting higher and higher.  That night he lost consciousness.
 
For three days he was in delirium, and Tarzan sat beside
him and bathed his head and hands and washed his wounds.
 
On the fourth day the fever broke as suddenly as it had
come, but it left D'Arnot a shadow of his former self, and
very weak.  Tarzan had to lift him that he might drink from
the gourd.
 
The fever had not been the result of infection, as D'Arnot
had thought, but one of those that commonly attack whites in
the jungles of Africa, and either kill or leave them as
suddenly as D'Arnot's had left him.
 
Two days later, D'Arnot was tottering about the amphitheater,
Tarzan's strong arm about him to keep him from falling.
 
They sat beneath the shade of a great tree, and Tarzan
found some smooth bark that they might converse.
 
D'Arnot wrote the first message:
 
 
What can I do to repay you for all that you have done for me?
 
 
And Tarzan, in reply:
 
 
Teach me to speak the language of men.
 
 
And so D'Arnot commenced at once, pointing out familiar
objects and repeating their names in French, for he thought
that it would be easier to teach this man his own language,
since he understood it himself best of all.
 
It meant nothing to Tarzan, of course, for he could not tell
one language from another, so when he pointed to the word
man which he had printed upon a piece of bark he learned
from D'Arnot that it was pronounced HOMME, and in the
same way he was taught to pronounce ape, SINGE and tree,
ARBRE.
 
He was a most eager student, and in two more days had
mastered so much French that he could speak little sentences
such as:  "That is a tree," "this is grass," "I am hungry," and
the like, but D'Arnot found that it was difficult to teach him
the French construction upon a foundation of English.
 
The Frenchman wrote little lessons for him in English and
had Tarzan repeat them in French, but as a literal translation
was usually very poor French Tarzan was often confused.
 
D'Arnot realized now that he had made a mistake, but it
seemed too late to go back and do it all over again and force
Tarzan to unlearn all that he had learned, especially as they
were rapidly approaching a point where they would be able
to converse.
 
On the third day after the fever broke Tarzan wrote a message
asking D'Arnot if he felt strong enough to be carried
back to the cabin.  Tarzan was as anxious to go as D'Arnot,
for he longed to see Jane again.
 
It had been hard for him to remain with the Frenchman
all these days for that very reason, and that he had
unselfishly done so spoke more glowingly of his nobility
of character than even did his rescuing the French officer
from Mbonga's clutches.
 
D'Arnot, only too willing to attempt the journey, wrote:
 
 
But you cannot carry me all the distance through this tangled forest.
 
 
Tarzan laughed.
 
"MAIS OUI," he said, and D'Arnot laughed aloud to hear
the phrase that he used so often glide from Tarzan's tongue.
 
So they set out, D'Arnot marveling as had Clayton and
Jane at the wondrous strength and agility of the apeman.
 
Mid-afternoon brought them to the clearing, and as Tarzan
dropped to earth from the branches of the last tree his heart
leaped and bounded against his ribs in anticipation of seeing
Jane so soon again.
 
No one was in sight outside the cabin, and D'Arnot was
perplexed to note that neither the cruiser nor the Arrow was
at anchor in the bay.
 
An atmosphere of loneliness pervaded the spot, which
caught suddenly at both men as they strode toward the cabin.
 
Neither spoke, yet both knew before they opened the
closed door what they would find beyond.
 
Tarzan lifted the latch and pushed the great door in upon
its wooden hinges.  It was as they had feared.  The cabin was
deserted.
 
The men turned and looked at one another.  D'Arnot knew
that his people thought him dead; but Tarzan thought only of
the woman who had kissed him in love and now had fled
from him while he was serving one of her people.
 
A great bitterness rose in his heart.  He would go away, far
into the jungle and join his tribe.  Never would he see one of
his own kind again, nor could he bear the thought of returning
to the cabin.  He would leave that forever behind him
with the great hopes he had nursed there of finding his own
race and becoming a man among men.
 
And the Frenchman?  D'Arnot?  What of him?  He could get
along as Tarzan had.  Tarzan did not want to see him more.
He wanted to get away from everything that might remind
him of Jane.
 
As Tarzan stood upon the threshold brooding, D'Arnot
had entered the cabin.  Many comforts he saw that had been
left behind.  He recognized numerous articles from the cruiser
--a camp oven, some kitchen utensils, a rifle and many
rounds of ammunition, canned foods, blankets, two chairs
and a cot--and several books and periodicals, mostly American.
 
"They must intend returning," thought D'Arnot.
 
He walked over to the table that John Clayton had built so
many years before to serve as a desk, and on it he saw two
notes addressed to Tarzan of the Apes.
 
One was in a strong masculine hand and was unsealed.  The
other, in a woman's hand, was sealed.
 
"Here are two messages for you, Tarzan of the Apes,"
cried D'Arnot, turning toward the door; but his companion
was not there.
 
D'Arnot walked to the door and looked out.  Tarzan was
nowhere in sight.  He called aloud but there was no response.
 
"MON DIEU!" exclaimed D'Arnot, "he has left me.  I feel it.
He has gone back into his jungle and left me here alone."
 
And then he remembered the look on Tarzan's face when
they had discovered that the cabin was empty--such a look
as the hunter sees in the eyes of the wounded deer he has
wantonly brought down.
 
The man had been hard hit--D'Arnot realized it now--
but why?  He could not understand.
 
The Frenchman looked about him.  The loneliness and the
horror of the place commenced to get on his nerves--already
weakened by the ordeal of suffering and sickness he had
passed through.
 
To be left here alone beside this awful jungle--never to
hear a human voice or see a human face--in constant dread
of savage beasts and more terribly savage men--a prey to
solitude and hopelessness.  It was awful.
 
And far to the east Tarzan of the Apes was speeding
through the middle terrace back to his tribe.  Never had he
traveled with such reckless speed.  He felt that he was running
away from himself--that by hurtling through the forest like
a frightened squirrel he was escaping from his own thoughts.
But no matter how fast he went he found them always with him.
 
He passed above the sinuous body of Sabor, the lioness, going
in the opposite direction--toward the cabin, thought Tarzan.
 
What could D'Arnot do against Sabor--or if Bolgani, the gorilla,
should come upon him--or Numa, the lion, or cruel Sheeta?
 
Tarzan paused in his flight.
 
"What are you, Tarzan?" he asked aloud.  "An ape or a man?"
 
"If you are an ape you will do as the apes would do--
leave one of your kind to die in the jungle if it suited
your whim to go elsewhere.
 
"If you are a man, you will return to protect your kind.
You will not run away from one of your own people, because
one of them has run away from you."
 
D'Arnot closed the cabin door.  He was very nervous.  Even
brave men, and D'Arnot was a brave man, are sometimes
frightened by solitude.
 
He loaded one of the rifles and placed it within easy reach.
Then he went to the desk and took up the unsealed letter
addressed to Tarzan.
 
Possibly it contained word that his people had but left the
beach temporarily.  He felt that it would be no breach of ethics
to read this letter, so he took the enclosure from the envelope
and read:
 
TO TARZAN OF THE APES:
 
 
We thank you for the use of your cabin, and are sorry that
you did not permit us the pleasure of seeing and thanking
you in person.
 
We have harmed nothing, but have left many things for
you which may add to your comfort and safety here in your
lonely home.
 
If you know the strange white man who saved our lives so
many times, and brought us food, and if you can converse
with him, thank him, also, for his kindness.
 
We sail within the hour, never to return; but we wish you
and that other jungle friend to know that we shall always
thank you for what you did for strangers on your shore, and
that we should have done infinitely more to reward you both
had you given us the opportunity.
              Very respectfully,
              WM. CECIL CLAYTON.
 
 
"`Never to return,'" muttered D'Arnot, and threw himself
face downward upon the cot.
 
An hour later he started up listening.  Something was at the
door trying to enter.
 
D'Arnot reached for the loaded rifle and placed it to his shoulder.
 
Dusk was falling, and the interior of the cabin was very
dark; but the man could see the latch moving from its place.
 
He felt his hair rising upon his scalp.
 
Gently the door opened until a thin crack showed something
standing just beyond.
 
D'Arnot sighted along the blue barrel at the crack of the
door--and then he pulled the trigger.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
When the expedition returned, following their fruitless
endeavor to succor D'Arnot, Captain Dufranne was
anxious to steam away as quickly as possible, and all save
Jane had acquiesced.
 
"No," she said, determinedly, "I shall not go, nor should
you, for there are two friends in that jungle who will come
out of it some day expecting to find us awaiting them.
 
"Your officer, Captain Dufranne, is one of them, and the
forest man who has saved the lives of every member of my
father's party is the other.
 
"He left me at the edge of the jungle two days ago to hasten
to the aid of my father and Mr. Clayton, as he thought,
and he has stayed to rescue Lieutenant D'Arnot; of that you
may be sure.
 
"Had he been too late to be of service to the lieutenant he
would have been back before now--the fact that he is not
back is sufficient proof to me that he is delayed because
Lieutenant D'Arnot is wounded, or he has had to follow his
captors further than the village which your sailors attacked."
 
"But poor D'Arnot's uniform and all his belongings were
found in that village, Miss Porter," argued the captain, "and
the natives showed great excitement when questioned as to
the white man's fate."
 
"Yes, Captain, but they did not admit that he was dead
and as for his clothes and accouterments being in their
possession--why more civilized peoples than these poor savage
negroes strip their prisoners of every article of value whether
they intend killing them or not.
 
"Even the soldiers of my own dear South looted not only the
living but the dead.  It is strong circumstantial evidence,
I will admit, but it is not positive proof."
 
"Possibly your forest man, himself was captured or killed
by the savages," suggested Captain Dufranne.
 
The girl laughed.
 
"You do not know him," she replied, a little thrill of pride
setting her nerves a-tingle at the thought that she spoke
of her own.
 
"I admit that he would be worth waiting for, this superman
of yours," laughed the captain.  "I most certainly should
like to see him."
 
"Then wait for him, my dear captain," urged the girl, "for
I intend doing so."
 
The Frenchman would have been a very much surprised man
could he have interpreted the true meaning of the girl's words.
 
They had been walking from the beach toward the cabin
as they talked, and now they joined a little group sitting on
camp stools in the shade of a great tree beside the cabin.
 
Professor Porter was there, and Mr. Philander and Clayton,
with Lieutenant Charpentier and two of his brother
officers, while Esmeralda hovered in the background, ever
and anon venturing opinions and comments with the freedom
of an old and much-indulged family servant.
 
The officers arose and saluted as their superior approached,
and Clayton surrendered his camp stool to Jane.
 
"We were just discussing poor Paul's fate," said Captain
Dufranne.  "Miss Porter insists that we have no absolute
proof of his death--nor have we.  And on the other hand she
maintains that the continued absence of your omnipotent jungle
friend indicates that D'Arnot is still in need of his services,
either because he is wounded, or still is a prisoner in a
more distant native village."
 
"It has been suggested," ventured Lieutenant Charpentier,
"that the wild man may have been a member of the tribe of
blacks who attacked our party--that he was hastening to aid
THEM--his own people."
 
Jane shot a quick glance at Clayton.
 
"It seems vastly more reasonable," said Professor Porter.
 
"I do not agree with you," objected Mr. Philander.  "He had
ample opportunity to harm us himself, or to lead his people
against us.  Instead, during our long residence here, he has
been uniformly consistent in his role of protector and provider."
 
"That is true," interjected Clayton, "yet we must not overlook
the fact that except for himself the only human beings
within hundreds of miles are savage cannibals.  He was armed
precisely as are they, which indicates that he has maintained
relations of some nature with them, and the fact that he is
but one against possibly thousands suggests that these relations
could scarcely have been other than friendly."
 
"It seems improbable then that he is not connected with
them," remarked the captain; "possibly a member of this tribe."
 
"Otherwise," added another of the officers, "how could he
have lived a sufficient length of time among the savage
denizens of the jungle, brute and human, to have become
proficient in woodcraft, or in the use of African weapons."
 
"You are judging him according to your own standards,
gentlemen," said Jane.  "An ordinary white man such as any
of you--pardon me, I did not mean just that--rather, a white
man above the ordinary in physique and intelligence could
never, I grant you, have lived a year alone and naked in this
tropical jungle; but this man not only surpasses the average
white man in strength and agility, but as far transcends our
trained athletes and `strong men' as they surpass a day-old
babe; and his courage and ferocity in battle are those of the
wild beast."
 
"He has certainly won a loyal champion, Miss Porter,"
said Captain Dufranne, laughing.  "I am sure that there be
none of us here but would willingly face death a hundred
times in its most terrifying forms to deserve the tributes
of one even half so loyal--or so beautiful."
 
"You would not wonder that I defend him," said the girl,
"could you have seen him as I saw him, battling in my behalf
with that huge hairy brute.
 
"Could you have seen him charge the monster as a bull
might charge a grizzly--absolutely without sign of fear or
hesitation--you would have believed him more than human.
 
"Could you have seen those mighty muscles knotting under
the brown skin--could you have seen them force back those
awful fangs--you too would have thought him invincible.
 
"And could you have seen the chivalrous treatment which
he accorded a strange girl of a strange race, you would
feel the same absolute confidence in him that I feel."
 
"You have won your suit, my fair pleader," cried the captain.
"This court finds the defendant not guilty, and the
cruiser shall wait a few days longer that he may have an
opportunity to come and thank the divine Portia."
 
"For the Lord's sake honey," cried Esmeralda.  "You all don't
mean to tell ME that you're going to stay right here in this
here land of carnivable animals when you all got the opportunity
to escapade on that boat?  Don't you tell me THAT, honey."
 
"Why, Esmeralda!  You should be ashamed of yourself,"
cried Jane.  "Is this any way to show your gratitude to the
man who saved your life twice?"
 
"Well, Miss Jane, that's all jest as you say; but that there
forest man never did save us to stay here.  He done save us so
we all could get AWAY from here.  I expect he be mighty
peevish when he find we ain't got no more sense than to stay
right here after he done give us the chance to get away.
 
"I hoped I'd never have to sleep in this here geological garden
another night and listen to all them lonesome noises that
come out of that jumble after dark."
 
"I don't blame you a bit, Esmeralda," said Clayton, "and you
certainly did hit it off right when you called them `lonesome'
noises.  I never have been able to find the right word for
them but that's it, don't you know, lonesome noises."
 
"You and Esmeralda had better go and live on the cruiser,"
said Jane, in fine scorn.  "What would you think if you
HAD to live all of your life in that jungle as our forest
man has done?"
 
"I'm afraid I'd be a blooming bounder as a wild man,"
laughed Clayton, ruefully.  "Those noises at night make the
hair on my head bristle.  I suppose that I should be ashamed
to admit it, but it's the truth."
 
"I don't know about that," said Lieutenant Charpentier.  "I
never thought much about fear and that sort of thing--never
tried to determine whether I was a coward or brave man; but
the other night as we lay in the jungle there after poor
D'Arnot was taken, and those jungle noises rose and fell
around us I began to think that I was a coward indeed.  It
was not the roaring and growling of the big beasts that
affected me so much as it was the stealthy noises--the ones
that you heard suddenly close by and then listened vainly for
a repetition of--the unaccountable sounds as of a great body
moving almost noiselessly, and the knowledge that you didn't
KNOW how close it was, or whether it were creeping closer
after you ceased to hear it?  It was those noises--and the eyes.
 
"MON DIEU!  I shall see them in the dark forever--the eyes
that you see, and those that you don't see, but feel--ah, they
are the worst."
 
All were silent for a moment, and then Jane spoke.
 
"And he is out there," she said, in an awe-hushed whisper.
"Those eyes will be glaring at him to-night, and at your
comrade Lieutenant D'Arnot.  Can you leave them, gentlemen,
without at least rendering them the passive succor which
remaining here a few days longer might insure them?"
 
"Tut, tut, child," said Professor Porter.  "Captain Dufranne
is willing to remain, and for my part I am perfectly willing,
perfectly willing--as I always have been to humor your
childish whims."
 
"We can utilize the morrow in recovering the chest,
Professor," suggested Mr. Philander.
 
"Quite so, quite so, Mr. Philander, I had almost forgotten
the treasure," exclaimed Professor Porter.  "Possibly we can
borrow some men from Captain Dufranne to assist us, and
one of the prisoners to point out the location of the chest."
 
"Most assuredly, my dear Professor, we are all yours to
command," said the captain.
 
And so it was arranged that on the next day Lieutenant
Charpentier was to take a detail of ten men, and one of the
mutineers of the Arrow as a guide, and unearth the treasure;
and that the cruiser would remain for a full week in the little
harbor.  At the end of that time it was to be assumed that
D'Arnot was truly dead, and that the forest man would not
return while they remained.  Then the two vessels were to
leave with all the party.
 
Professor Porter did not accompany the treasure-seekers
on the following day, but when he saw them returning
empty-handed toward noon, he hastened forward to meet them
--his usual preoccupied indifference entirely vanished, and in
its place a nervous and excited manner.
 
"Where is the treasure?" he cried to Clayton, while yet a
hundred feet separated them.
 
Clayton shook his head.
 
"Gone," he said, as he neared the professor.
 
"Gone!  It cannot be.  Who could have taken it?" cried
Professor Porter.
 
"God only knows, Professor," replied Clayton.  "We might
have thought the fellow who guided us was lying about the
location, but his surprise and consternation on finding no
chest beneath the body of the murdered Snipes were too real
to be feigned.  And then our spades showed us that SOMETHING
had been buried beneath the corpse, for a hole had been
there and it had been filled with loose earth."
 
"But who could have taken it?" repeated Professor Porter.
 
"Suspicion might naturally fall on the men of the cruiser,"
said Lieutenant Charpentier, "but for the fact that sub-lieutenant
Janviers here assures me that no men have had shore
leave--that none has been on shore since we anchored here
except under command of an officer.  I do not know that you
would suspect our men, but I am glad that there is now no
chance for suspicion to fall on them," he concluded.
 
"It would never have occurred to me to suspect the men to
whom we owe so much," replied Professor Porter, graciously.
"I would as soon suspect my dear Clayton here, or
Mr. Philander."
 
The Frenchmen smiled, both officers and sailors.  It was
plain to see that a burden had been lifted from their minds.
 
"The treasure has been gone for some time," continued Clayton.
"In fact the body fell apart as we lifted it, which indicates
that whoever removed the treasure did so while the corpse was
still fresh, for it was intact when we first uncovered it."
 
"There must have been several in the party," said Jane,
who had joined them.  "You remember that it took four men
to carry it."
 
"By jove!" cried Clayton.  "That's right.  It must have been
done by a party of blacks.  Probably one of them saw the men
bury the chest and then returned immediately after with a
party of his friends, and carried it off."
 
"Speculation is futile," said Professor Porter sadly.  "The
chest is gone.  We shall never see it again, nor the treasure
that was in it."
 
Only Jane knew what the loss meant to her father, and
none there knew what it meant to her.
 
Six days later Captain Dufranne announced that they
would sail early on the morrow.
 
Jane would have begged for a further reprieve, had it not
been that she too had begun to believe that her forest lover
would return no more.
 
In spite of herself she began to entertain doubts and fears.
The reasonableness of the arguments of these disinterested
French officers commenced to convince her against her will.
 
That he was a cannibal she would not believe, but that he
was an adopted member of some savage tribe at length
seemed possible to her.
 
She would not admit that he could be dead.  It was impossible
to believe that that perfect body, so filled with triumphant
life, could ever cease to harbor the vital spark--as soon
believe that immortality were dust.
 
As Jane permitted herself to harbor these thoughts, others
equally unwelcome forced themselves upon her.
 
If he belonged to some savage tribe he had a savage wife
--a dozen of them perhaps--and wild, half-caste children.
The girl shuddered, and when they told her that the cruiser
would sail on the morrow she was almost glad.
 
It was she, though, who suggested that arms, ammunition,
supplies and comforts be left behind in the cabin, ostensibly
for that intangible personality who had signed himself Tarzan
of the Apes, and for D'Arnot should he still be living, but
really, she hoped, for her forest god--even though his feet
should prove of clay.
 
And at the last minute she left a message for him, to be
transmitted by Tarzan of the Apes.
 
She was the last to leave the cabin, returning on some trivial
pretext after the others had started for the boat.
 
She kneeled down beside the bed in which she had spent so
many nights, and offered up a prayer for the safety of her
primeval man, and crushing his locket to her lips she murmured:
 
"I love you, and because I love you I believe in you.  But if
I did not believe, still should I love.  Had you come back for
me, and had there been no other way, I would have gone into
the jungle with you--forever."
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
With the report of his gun D'Arnot saw the door fly open
and the figure of a man pitch headlong within onto the
cabin floor.
 
The Frenchman in his panic raised his gun to fire again
into the prostrate form, but suddenly in the half dusk of the
open door he saw that the man was white and in another instant
realized that he had shot his friend and protector, Tarzan of the Apes.
 
With a cry of anguish D'Arnot sprang to the ape-man's side,
and kneeling, lifted the latter's head in his arms--calling
Tarzan's name aloud.
 
There was no response, and then D'Arnot placed his ear above
the man's heart.  To his joy he heard its steady beating beneath.
 
Carefully he lifted Tarzan to the cot, and then, after closing
and bolting the door, he lighted one of the lamps and examined
the wound.
 
The bullet had struck a glancing blow upon the skull.
There was an ugly flesh wound, but no signs of a fracture of
the skull.
 
D'Arnot breathed a sigh of relief, and went about bathing
the blood from Tarzan's face.
 
Soon the cool water revived him, and presently he opened
his eyes to look in questioning surprise at D'Arnot.
 
The latter had bound the wound with pieces of cloth, and
as he saw that Tarzan had regained consciousness he arose
and going to the table wrote a message, which he handed to
the ape-man, explaining the terrible mistake he had made and
how thankful he was that the wound was not more serious.
 
Tarzan, after reading the message, sat on the edge of the
couch and laughed.
 
 
"It is nothing," he said in French, and then, his vocabulary
failing him, he wrote:
 
You should have seen what Bolgani did to me, and Kerchak,
and Terkoz, before I killed them--then you would
laugh at such a little scratch.
 
 
D'Arnot handed Tarzan the two messages that had been
left for him.
 
Tarzan read the first one through with a look of sorrow on
his face.  The second one he turned over and over, searching
for an opening--he had never seen a sealed envelope before.
At length he handed it to D'Arnot.
 
The Frenchman had been watching him, and knew that Tarzan
was puzzled over the envelope.  How strange it seemed that
to a full-grown white man an envelope was a mystery.
D'Arnot opened it and handed the letter back to Tarzan.
 
Sitting on a camp stool the ape-man spread the written
sheet before him and read:
 
TO TARZAN OF THE APES:
 
Before I leave let me add my thanks to those of Mr. Clayton
for the kindness you have shown in permitting us the use
of your cabin.
 
That you never came to make friends with us has been a
great regret to us.  We should have liked so much to have
seen and thanked our host.
 
There is another I should like to thank also, but he did not
come back, though I cannot believe that he is dead.
 
I do not know his name.  He is the great white giant who
wore the diamond locket upon his breast.
 
If you know him and can speak his language carry my
thanks to him, and tell him that I waited seven days for him
to return.
 
Tell him, also, that in my home in America, in the city of
Baltimore, there will always be a welcome for him if he cares
to come.
 
I found a note you wrote me lying among the leaves beneath
a tree near the cabin.  I do not know how you learned to
love me, who have never spoken to me, and I am very sorry
if it is true, for I have already given my heart to another.
 
But know that I am always your friend,
                                  JANE PORTER.
 
 
Tarzan sat with gaze fixed upon the floor for nearly an
hour.  It was evident to him from the notes that they did not
know that he and Tarzan of the Apes were one and the same.
 
"I have given my heart to another," he repeated over and
over again to himself.
 
Then she did not love him!  How could she have pretended
love, and raised him to such a pinnacle of hope only to cast
him down to such utter depths of despair!
 
Maybe her kisses were only signs of friendship.  How did
he know, who knew nothing of the customs of human beings?
 
Suddenly he arose, and, bidding D'Arnot good night as he
had learned to do, threw himself upon the couch of ferns that
had been Jane Porter's.
 
D'Arnot extinguished the lamp, and lay down upon the cot.
 
For a week they did little but rest, D'Arnot coaching Tarzan
in French.  At the end of that time the two men could
converse quite easily.
 
One night, as they were sitting within the cabin before
retiring, Tarzan turned to D'Arnot.
 
"Where is America?" he said.
 
D'Arnot pointed toward the northwest.
 
"Many thousands of miles across the ocean," he replied.  "Why?"
 
"I am going there."
 
D'Arnot shook his head.
 
"It is impossible, my friend," he said.
 
Tarzan rose, and, going to one of the cupboards, returned
with a well-thumbed geography.
 
Turning to a map of the world, he said:
 
"I have never quite understood all this; explain it to me, please."
 
When D'Arnot had done so, showing him that the blue
represented all the water on the earth, and the bits of other
colors the continents and islands, Tarzan asked him to point
out the spot where they now were.
 
D'Arnot did so.
 
"Now point out America," said Tarzan.
 
And as D'Arnot placed his finger upon North America,
Tarzan smiled and laid his palm upon the page, spanning the
great ocean that lay between the two continents.
 
"You see it is not so very far," he said; "scarce the width
of my hand."
 
D'Arnot laughed.  How could he make the man understand?
 
Then he took a pencil and made a tiny point upon the
shore of Africa.
 
"This little mark," he said, "is many times larger upon this
map than your cabin is upon the earth.  Do you see now how
very far it is?"
 
Tarzan thought for a long time.
 
"Do any white men live in Africa?" he asked.
 
"Yes."
 
"Where are the nearest?"
 
D'Arnot pointed out a spot on the shore just north of them.
 
"So close?" asked Tarzan, in surprise.
 
"Yes," said D'Arnot; "but it is not close."
 
"Have they big boats to cross the ocean?"
 
"Yes."
 
"We shall go there to-morrow," announced Tarzan.
 
Again D'Arnot smiled and shook his head.
 
"It is too far.  We should die long before we reached them."
 
"Do you wish to stay here then forever?" asked Tarzan.
 
"No," said D'Arnot.
 
"Then we shall start to-morrow.  I do not like it here
longer.  I should rather die than remain here."
 
"Well," answered D'Arnot, with a shrug, "I do not know,
my friend, but that I also would rather die than remain here.
If you go, I shall go with you."
 
"It is settled then," said Tarzan.  "I shall start for America
to-morrow."
 
"How will you get to America without money?" asked D'Arnot.
 
"What is money?" inquired Tarzan.
 
It took a long time to make him understand even imperfectly.
 
"How do men get money?" he asked at last.
 
"They work for it."
 
"Very well.  I will work for it, then."
 
"No, my friend," returned D'Arnot, "you need not worry
about money, nor need you work for it.  I have enough
money for two--enough for twenty.  Much more than is good
for one man and you shall have all you need if ever we
reach civilization."
 
So on the following day they started north along the shore.
Each man carrying a rifle and ammunition, beside bedding
and some food and cooking utensils.
 
The latter seemed to Tarzan a most useless encumbrance,
so he threw his away.
 
"But you must learn to eat cooked food, my friend,"
remonstrated D'Arnot.  "No civilized men eat raw flesh."
 
"There will be time enough when I reach civilization," said
Tarzan.  "I do not like the things and they only spoil the taste
of good meat."
 
For a month they traveled north.  Sometimes finding food
in plenty and again going hungry for days.
 
They saw no signs of natives nor were they molested by
wild beasts.  Their journey was a miracle of ease.
 
Tarzan asked questions and learned rapidly.  D'Arnot
taught him many of the refinements of civilization--even to
the use of knife and fork; but sometimes Tarzan would drop
them in disgust and grasp his food in his strong brown hands,
tearing it with his molars like a wild beast.
 
Then D'Arnot would expostulate with him, saying:
 
"You must not eat like a brute, Tarzan, while I am trying
to make a gentleman of you.  MON DIEU!  Gentlemen do not
thus--it is terrible."
 
Tarzan would grin sheepishly and pick up his knife and
fork again, but at heart he hated them.
 
On the journey he told D'Arnot about the great chest he had
seen the sailors bury; of how he had dug it up and carried
it to the gathering place of the apes and buried it there.
 
"It must be the treasure chest of Professor Porter," said
D'Arnot.  "It is too bad, but of course you did not know."
 
Then Tarzan recalled the letter written by Jane to her
friend--the one he had stolen when they first came to his
cabin, and now he knew what was in the chest and what it
meant to Jane.
 
"To-morrow we shall go back after it," he announced to D'Arnot.
 
"Go back?" exclaimed D'Arnot.  "But, my dear fellow, we
have now been three weeks upon the march.  It would require
three more to return to the treasure, and then, with that
enormous weight which required, you say, four sailors to carry,
it would be months before we had again reached this spot."
 
"It must be done, my friend," insisted Tarzan.  "You may go
on toward civilization, and I will return for the treasure.
I can go very much faster alone."
 
"I have a better plan, Tarzan," exclaimed D'Arnot.  "We
shall go on together to the nearest settlement, and there we
will charter a boat and sail back down the coast for the treasure
and so transport it easily.  That will be safer and quicker
and also not require us to be separated.  What do you think of
that plan?"
 
"Very well," said Tarzan.  "The treasure will be there
whenever we go for it; and while I could fetch it now, and
catch up with you in a moon or two, I shall feel safer for you
to know that you are not alone on the trail.  When I see how
helpless you are, D'Arnot, I often wonder how the human race
has escaped annihilation all these ages which you tell me about.
Why, Sabor, single handed, could exterminate a thousand of you."
 
D'Arnot laughed.
 
"You will think more highly of your genus when you have
seen its armies and navies, its great cities, and its mighty
engineering works.  Then you will realize that it is mind, and
not muscle, that makes the human animal greater than the
mighty beasts of your jungle.
 
"Alone and unarmed, a single man is no match for any of
the larger beasts; but if ten men were together, they would
combine their wits and their muscles against their savage
enemies, while the beasts, being unable to reason, would never
think of combining against the men.  Otherwise, Tarzan of the
Apes, how long would you have lasted in the savage wilderness?"
 
"You are right, D'Arnot," replied Tarzan, "for if Kerchak
had come to Tublat's aid that night at the Dum-Dum, there
would have been an end of me.  But Kerchak could never
think far enough ahead to take advantage of any such
opportunity.  Even Kala, my mother, could never plan ahead.
She simply ate what she needed when she needed it, and if the
supply was very scarce, even though she found plenty for
several meals, she would never gather any ahead.
 
"I remember that she used to think it very silly of me to
burden myself with extra food upon the march, though she
was quite glad to eat it with me, if the way chanced to be
barren of sustenance."
 
"Then you knew your mother, Tarzan?" asked D'Arnot, in surprise.
 
"Yes.  She was a great, fine ape, larger than I, and weighing
twice as much."
 
"And your father?" asked D'Arnot.
 
"I did not know him.  Kala told me he was a white ape,
and hairless like myself.  I know now that he must have
been a white man."
 
D'Arnot looked long and earnestly at his companion.
 
"Tarzan," he said at length, "it is impossible that the ape,
Kala, was your mother.  If such a thing can be, which I
doubt, you would have inherited some of the characteristics
of the ape, but you have not--you are pure man, and, I
should say, the offspring of highly bred and intelligent
parents.  Have you not the slightest clue to your past?"
 
"Not the slightest," replied Tarzan.
 
"No writings in the cabin that might have told something
of the lives of its original inmates?"
 
"I have read everything that was in the cabin with the
exception of one book which I know now to be written in a
language other than English.  Possibly you can read it."
 
Tarzan fished the little black diary from the bottom of his
quiver, and handed it to his companion.
 
D'Arnot glanced at the title page.
 
"It is the diary of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, an
English nobleman, and it is written in French," he said.
 
Then he proceeded to read the diary that had been written
over twenty years before, and which recorded the details of
the story which we already know--the story of adventure,
hardships and sorrow of John Clayton and his wife Alice,
from the day they left England until an hour before he was
struck down by Kerchak.
 
D'Arnot read aloud.  At times his voice broke, and he was
forced to stop reading for the pitiful hopelessness that spoke
between the lines.
 
Occasionally he glanced at Tarzan; but the ape-man sat
upon his haunches, like a carven image, his eyes fixed upon
the ground.
 
Only when the little babe was mentioned did the tone of the
diary alter from the habitual note of despair which had crept
into it by degrees after the first two months upon the shore.
 
Then the passages were tinged with a subdued happiness
that was even sadder than the rest.
 
One entry showed an almost hopeful spirit.
 
To-day our little boy is six months old.  He is sitting in
Alice's lap beside the table where I am writing--a happy,
healthy, perfect child.
 
Somehow, even against all reason, I seem to see him a
grown man, taking his father's place in the world--the
second John Clayton--and bringing added honors to the house
of Greystoke.
 
There--as though to give my prophecy the weight of his
endorsement--he has grabbed my pen in his chubby fists and
with his inkbegrimed little fingers has placed the seal of his
tiny finger prints upon the page.
 
And there, on the margin of the page, were the partially blurred
imprints of four wee fingers and the outer half of the thumb.
 
When D'Arnot had finished the diary the two men sat in
silence for some minutes.
 
"Well!  Tarzan of the Apes, what think you?" asked D'Arnot.
"Does not this little book clear up the mystery of
your parentage?
 
"Why man, you are Lord Greystoke."
 
"The book speaks of but one child," he replied.  "Its little
skeleton lay in the crib, where it died crying for nourishment,
from the first time I entered the cabin until Professor Porter's
party buried it, with its father and mother, beside the cabin.
 
"No, that was the babe the book speaks of--and the mystery
of my origin is deeper than before, for I have thought
much of late of the possibility of that cabin having been my
birthplace.  I am afraid that Kala spoke the truth," he
concluded sadly.
 
D'Arnot shook his head.  He was unconvinced, and in his
mind had sprung the determination to prove the correctness
of his theory, for he had discovered the key which alone
could unlock the mystery, or consign it forever to the realms
of the unfathomable.
 
A week later the two men came suddenly upon a clearing
in the forest.
 
In the distance were several buildings surrounded by a
strong palisade.  Between them and the enclosure stretched a
cultivated field in which a number of negroes were working.
 
The two halted at the edge of the jungle.
 
Tarzan fitted his bow with a poisoned arrow, but D'Arnot
placed a hand upon his arm.
 
"What would you do, Tarzan?" he asked.
 
"They will try to kill us if they see us," replied Tarzan.
"I prefer to be the killer."
 
"Maybe they are friends," suggested D'Arnot.
 
"They are black," was Tarzan's only reply.
 
And again he drew back his shaft.
 
"You must not, Tarzan!" cried D'Arnot.  "White men do
not kill wantonly.  MON DIEU! but you have much to learn.
 
"I pity the ruffian who crosses you, my wild man, when I
take you to Paris.  I will have my hands full keeping your
neck from beneath the guillotine."
 
Tarzan lowered his bow and smiled.
 
"I do not know why I should kill the blacks back there in
my jungle, yet not kill them here.  Suppose Numa, the lion,
should spring out upon us, I should say, then, I presume:
Good morning, Monsieur Numa, how is Madame Numa; eh?"
 
"Wait until the blacks spring upon you," replied D'Arnot,
"then you may kill them.  Do not assume that men are your
enemies until they prove it."
 
"Come," said Tarzan, "let us go and present ourselves to
be killed," and he started straight across the field, his head
high held and the tropical sun beating upon his smooth,
brown skin.
 
Behind him came D'Arnot, clothed in some garments
which had been discarded at the cabin by Clayton when the
officers of the French cruiser had fitted him out in more
presentable fashion.
 
Presently one of the blacks looked up, and beholding Tarzan,
turned, shrieking, toward the palisade.
 
In an instant the air was filled with cries of terror from the
fleeing gardeners, but before any had reached the palisade a
white man emerged from the enclosure, rifle in hand, to discover
the cause of the commotion.
 
What he saw brought his rifle to his shoulder, and Tarzan
of the Apes would have felt cold lead once again had not
D'Arnot cried loudly to the man with the leveled gun:
 
"Do not fire!  We are friends!"
 
"Halt, then!" was the reply.
 
"Stop, Tarzan!" cried D'Arnot.  "He thinks we are enemies."
 
Tarzan dropped into a walk, and together he and D'Arnot
advanced toward the white man by the gate.
 
The latter eyed them in puzzled bewilderment.
 
"What manner of men are you?" he asked, in French.
 
"White men," replied D'Arnot.  "We have been lost in the
jungle for a long time."
 
The man had lowered his rifle and now advanced with
outstretched hand.
 
"I am Father Constantine of the French Mission here," he
said, "and I am glad to welcome you."
 
"This is Monsieur Tarzan, Father Constantine," replied
D'Arnot, indicating the ape-man; and as the priest extended
his hand to Tarzan, D'Arnot added: "and I am Paul D'Arnot,
of the French Navy."
 
Father Constantine took the hand which Tarzan extended
in imitation of the priest's act, while the latter took in
the superb physique and handsome face in one quick, keen glance.
 
And thus came Tarzan of the Apes to the first outpost of
civilization.
 
For a week they remained there, and the ape-man, keenly
observant, learned much of the ways of men; meanwhile black
women sewed white duck garments for himself and D'Arnot so
that they might continue their journey properly clothed.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
Another month brought them to a little group of buildings
at the mouth of a wide river, and there Tarzan saw many
boats, and was filled with the timidity of the wild thing by
the sight of many men.
 
Gradually he became accustomed to the strange noises and
the odd ways of civilization, so that presently none might
know that two short months before, this handsome Frenchman
in immaculate white ducks, who laughed and chatted
with the gayest of them, had been swinging naked through
primeval forests to pounce upon some unwary victim, which,
raw, was to fill his savage belly.
 
The knife and fork, so contemptuously flung aside a month
before, Tarzan now manipulated as exquisitely as did the
polished D'Arnot.
 
So apt a pupil had he been that the young Frenchman had labored
assiduously to make of Tarzan of the Apes a polished gentleman
in so far as nicety of manners and speech were concerned.
 
"God made you a gentleman at heart, my friend," D'Arnot had
said; "but we want His works to show upon the exterior also."
 
As soon as they had reached the little port, D'Arnot had
cabled his government of his safety, and requested a three-
months' leave, which had been granted.
 
He had also cabled his bankers for funds, and the enforced
wait of a month, under which both chafed, was due to their
inability to charter a vessel for the return to Tarzan's jungle
after the treasure.
 
During their stay at the coast town "Monsieur Tarzan" became
the wonder of both whites and blacks because of several
occurrences which to Tarzan seemed the merest of nothings.
 
Once a huge black, crazed by drink, had run amuck and
terrorized the town, until his evil star had led him to where the
black-haired French giant lolled upon the veranda of the hotel.
 
Mounting the broad steps, with brandished knife, the
Negro made straight for a party of four men sitting at
a table sipping the inevitable absinthe.
 
Shouting in alarm, the four took to their heels, and then
the black spied Tarzan.
 
With a roar he charged the ape-man, while half a hundred
heads peered from sheltering windows and doorways to witness
the butchering of the poor Frenchman by the giant black.
 
Tarzan met the rush with the fighting smile that the joy of
battle always brought to his lips.
 
As the Negro closed upon him, steel muscles gripped the
black wrist of the uplifted knife-hand, and a single swift
wrench left the hand dangling below a broken bone.
 
With the pain and surprise, the madness left the black
man, and as Tarzan dropped back into his chair the fellow
turned, crying with agony, and dashed wildly toward the
native village.
 
On another occasion as Tarzan and D'Arnot sat at dinner
with a number of other whites, the talk fell upon lions and
lion hunting.
 
Opinion was divided as to the bravery of the king of beasts
--some maintaining that he was an arrant coward, but all
agreeing that it was with a feeling of greater security that
they gripped their express rifles when the monarch of the
jungle roared about a camp at night.
 
D'Arnot and Tarzan had agreed that his past be kept secret,
and so none other than the French officer knew of the
ape-man's familiarity with the beasts of the jungle.
 
"Monsieur Tarzan has not expressed himself," said one of
the party.  "A man of his prowess who has spent some time in
Africa, as I understand Monsieur Tarzan has, must have had
experiences with lions--yes?"
 
"Some," replied Tarzan, dryly.  "Enough to know that each
of you are right in your judgment of the characteristics of the
lions--you have met.  But one might as well judge all blacks
by the fellow who ran amuck last week, or decide that all
whites are cowards because one has met a cowardly white.
 
"There is as much individuality among the lower orders,
gentlemen, as there is among ourselves.  Today we may go out
and stumble upon a lion which is over-timid--he runs away
from us.  To-morrow we may meet his uncle or his twin
brother, and our friends wonder why we do not return from
the jungle.  For myself, I always assume that a lion is
ferocious, and so I am never caught off my guard."
 
"There would be little pleasure in hunting," retorted the
first speaker, "if one is afraid of the thing he hunts."
 
D'Arnot smiled.  Tarzan afraid!
 
"I do not exactly understand what you mean by fear," said
Tarzan.  "Like lions, fear is a different thing in different men,
but to me the only pleasure in the hunt is the knowledge that
the hunted thing has power to harm me as much as I have to
harm him.  If I went out with a couple of rifles and a gun
bearer, and twenty or thirty beaters, to hunt a lion, I should
not feel that the lion had much chance, and so the pleasure
of the hunt would be lessened in proportion to the increased
safety which I felt."
 
"Then I am to take it that Monsieur Tarzan would prefer
to go naked into the jungle, armed only with a jackknife, to
kill the king of beasts," laughed the other, good naturedly,
but with the merest touch of sarcasm in his tone.
 
"And a piece of rope," added Tarzan.
 
Just then the deep roar of a lion sounded from the distant
jungle, as though to challenge whoever dared enter the lists
with him.
 
"There is your opportunity, Monsieur Tarzan," bantered
the Frenchman.
 
"I am not hungry," said Tarzan simply.
 
The men laughed, all but D'Arnot.  He alone knew that a
savage beast had spoken its simple reason through the lips of
the ape-man.
 
"But you are afraid, just as any of us would be, to go out
there naked, armed only with a knife and a piece of rope,"
said the banterer.  "Is it not so?"
 
"No," replied Tarzan.  "Only a fool performs any act
without reason."
 
"Five thousand francs is a reason," said the other.  "I
wager you that amount you cannot bring back a lion from
the jungle under the conditions we have named--naked and
armed only with a knife and a piece of rope."
 
Tarzan glanced toward D'Arnot and nodded his head.
 
"Make it ten thousand," said D'Arnot.
 
"Done," replied the other.
 
Tarzan arose.
 
"I shall have to leave my clothes at the edge of the settlement,
so that if I do not return before daylight I shall have
something to wear through the streets."
 
"You are not going now," exclaimed the wagerer--"at night?"
 
"Why not?" asked Tarzan.  "Numa walks abroad at night
--it will be easier to find him."
 
"No," said the other, "I do not want your blood upon my
hands.  It will be foolhardy enough if you go forth by day."
 
"I shall go now," replied Tarzan, and went to his room for
his knife and rope.
 
The men accompanied him to the edge of the jungle,
where he left his clothes in a small storehouse.
 
But when he would have entered the blackness of the
undergrowth they tried to dissuade him; and the wagerer was
most insistent of all that he abandon his foolhardy venture.
 
"I will accede that you have won," he said, "and the ten
thousand francs are yours if you will but give up this
foolish attempt, which can only end in your death."
 
Tarzan laughed, and in another moment the jungle had
swallowed him.
 
The men stood silent for some moments and then slowly
turned and walked back to the hotel veranda.
 
Tarzan had no sooner entered the jungle than he took to
the trees, and it was with a feeling of exultant freedom that
he swung once more through the forest branches.
 
This was life!  Ah, how he loved it!  Civilization held nothing
like this in its narrow and circumscribed sphere, hemmed
in by restrictions and conventionalities.  Even clothes were a
hindrance and a nuisance.
 
At last he was free.  He had not realized what a prisoner he
had been.
 
How easy it would be to circle back to the coast, and then
make toward the south and his own jungle and cabin.
 
Now he caught the scent of Numa, for he was traveling up
wind.  Presently his quick ears detected the familiar sound of
padded feet and the brushing of a huge, fur-clad body
through the undergrowth.
 
Tarzan came quietly above the unsuspecting beast and silently
stalked him until he came into a little patch of moonlight.
 
Then the quick noose settled and tightened about the
tawny throat, and, as he had done it a hundred times in the
past, Tarzan made fast the end to a strong branch and, while
the beast fought and clawed for freedom, dropped to the
ground behind him, and leaping upon the great back, plunged
his long thin blade a dozen times into the fierce heart.
 
Then with his foot upon the carcass of Numa, he raised his
voice in the awesome victory cry of his savage tribe.
 
For a moment Tarzan stood irresolute, swayed by conflicting
emotions of loyalty to D'Arnot and a mighty lust for the
freedom of his own jungle.  At last the vision of a beautiful
face, and the memory of warm lips crushed to his dissolved
the fascinating picture he had been drawing of his old life.
 
The ape-man threw the warm carcass of Numa across his
shoulders and took to the trees once more.
 
The men upon the veranda had sat for an hour, almost in silence.
 
They had tried ineffectually to converse on various subjects,
and always the thing uppermost in the mind of each
had caused the conversation to lapse.
 
"MON DIEU," said the wagerer at length, "I can endure it
no longer.  I am going into the jungle with my express and
bring back that mad man."
 
"I will go with you," said one.
 
"And I"--"And I"--"And I," chorused the others.
 
As though the suggestion had broken the spell of some
horrid nightmare they hastened to their various quarters, and
presently were headed toward the jungle--each one heavily armed.
 
"God!  What was that?" suddenly cried one of the party, an
Englishman, as Tarzan's savage cry came faintly to their ears.
 
"I heard the same thing once before," said a Belgian,
"when I was in the gorilla country.  My carriers said it
was the cry of a great bull ape who has made a kill."
 
D'Arnot remembered Clayton's description of the awful
roar with which Tarzan had announced his kills, and he half
smiled in spite of the horror which filled him to think that
the uncanny sound could have issued from a human throat
--from the lips of his friend.
 
As the party stood finally near the edge of the jungle,
debating as to the best distribution of their forces, they were
startled by a low laugh near them, and turning, beheld advancing
toward them a giant figure bearing a dead lion upon
its broad shoulders.
 
Even D'Arnot was thunderstruck, for it seemed impossible
that the man could have so quickly dispatched a lion with the
pitiful weapons he had taken, or that alone he could have
borne the huge carcass through the tangled jungle.
 
The men crowded about Tarzan with many questions, but
his only answer was a laughing depreciation of his feat.
 
To Tarzan it was as though one should eulogize a butcher
for his heroism in killing a cow, for Tarzan had killed so
often for food and for self-preservation that the act seemed
anything but remarkable to him.  But he was indeed a hero in
the eyes of these men--men accustomed to hunting big game.
 
Incidentally, he had won ten thousand francs, for D'Arnot
insisted that he keep it all.
 
This was a very important item to Tarzan, who was just
commencing to realize the power which lay beyond the little
pieces of metal and paper which always changed hands when
human beings rode, or ate, or slept, or clothed themselves, or
drank, or worked, or played, or sheltered themselves from
the rain or cold or sun.
 
It had become evident to Tarzan that without money one
must die.  D'Arnot had told him not to worry, since he had
more than enough for both, but the ape-man was learning
many things and one of them was that people looked down
upon one who accepted money from another without giving
something of equal value in exchange.
 
Shortly after the episode of the lion hunt, D'Arnot
succeeded in chartering an ancient tub for the coastwise
trip to Tarzan's land-locked harbor.
 
It was a happy morning for them both when the little vessel
weighed anchor and made for the open sea.
 
The trip to the beach was uneventful, and the morning
after they dropped anchor before the cabin, Tarzan, garbed
once more in his jungle regalia and carrying a spade, set out
alone for the amphitheater of the apes where lay the treasure.
 
Late the next day he returned, bearing the great chest upon
his shoulder, and at sunrise the little vessel worked through
the harbor's mouth and took up her northward journey.
 
Three weeks later Tarzan and D'Arnot were passengers on
board a French steamer bound for Lyons, and after a few
days in that city D'Arnot took Tarzan to Paris.
 
The ape-man was anxious to proceed to America, but
D'Arnot insisted that he must accompany him to Paris first,
nor would he divulge the nature of the urgent necessity upon
which he based his demand.
 
One of the first things which D'Arnot accomplished after
their arrival was to arrange to visit a high official of the
police department, an old friend; and to take Tarzan with him.
 
Adroitly D'Arnot led the conversation from point to point until
the policeman had explained to the interested Tarzan many of
the methods in vogue for apprehending and identifying criminals.
 
Not the least interesting to Tarzan was the part played by
finger prints in this fascinating science.
 
"But of what value are these imprints," asked Tarzan,
"when, after a few years the lines upon the fingers are
entirely changed by the wearing out of the old tissue and the
growth of new?"
 
"The lines never change," replied the official.  "From infancy
to senility the fingerprints of an individual change only
in size, except as injuries alter the loops and whorls.  But if
imprints have been taken of the thumb and four fingers of both
hands one must needs lose all entirely to escape identification."
 
"It is marvelous," exclaimed D'Arnot.  "I wonder what the
lines upon my own fingers may resemble."
 
"We can soon see," replied the police officer, and ringing a
bell he summoned an assistant to whom he issued a few directions.
 
The man left the room, but presently returned with a little
hardwood box which he placed on his superior's desk.
 
"Now," said the officer, "you shall have your fingerprints
in a second."
 
He drew from the little case a square of plate glass, a little
tube of thick ink, a rubber roller, and a few snowy white cards.
 
Squeezing a drop of ink onto the glass, he spread it back
and forth with the rubber roller until the entire surface of the
glass was covered to his satisfaction with a very thin and uniform
layer of ink.
 
"Place the four fingers of your right hand upon the glass,
thus," he said to D'Arnot.  "Now the thumb.  That is right.
Now place them in just the same position upon this card,
here, no--a little to the right.  We must leave room for the
thumb and the fingers of the left hand.  There, that's it.  Now
the same with the left."
 
"Come, Tarzan," cried D'Arnot, "let's see what your
whorls look like."
 
Tarzan complied readily, asking many questions of the officer
during the operation.
 
"Do fingerprints show racial characteristics?" he asked.
"Could you determine, for example, solely from fingerprints
whether the subject was Negro or Caucasian?"
 
"I think not," replied the officer.
 
"Could the finger prints of an ape be detected from those
of a man?"
 
"Probably, because the ape's would be far simpler than
those of the higher organism."
 
"But a cross between an ape and a man might show the
characteristics of either progenitor?" continued Tarzan.
 
"Yes, I should think likely," responded the official; "but
the science has not progressed sufficiently to render it exact
enough in such matters.  I should hate to trust its findings
further than to differentiate between individuals.  There it is
absolute.  No two people born into the world probably have ever
had identical lines upon all their digits.  It is very doubtful if
any single fingerprint will ever be exactly duplicated by any
finger other than the one which originally made it."
 
"Does the comparison require much time or labor?" asked D'Arnot.
 
"Ordinarily but a few moments, if the impressions are distinct."
 
D'Arnot drew a little black book from his pocket and commenced
turning the pages.
 
Tarzan looked at the book in surprise.  How did D'Arnot
come to have his book?
 
Presently D'Arnot stopped at a page on which were five
tiny little smudges.
 
He handed the open book to the policeman.
 
"Are these imprints similar to mine or Monsieur Tarzan's
or can you say that they are identical with either?"
The officer drew a powerful glass from his desk and
examined all three specimens carefully, making notations
meanwhile upon a pad of paper.
 
Tarzan realized now what was the meaning of their visit to
the police officer.
 
The answer to his life's riddle lay in these tiny marks.
 
With tense nerves he sat leaning forward in his chair, but
suddenly he relaxed and dropped back, smiling.
 
D'Arnot looked at him in surprise.
 
"You forget that for twenty years the dead body of the
child who made those fingerprints lay in the cabin of his
father, and that all my life I have seen it lying there,"
said Tarzan bitterly.
 
The policeman looked up in astonishment.
 
"Go ahead, captain, with your examination," said D'Arnot,
"we will tell you the story later--provided Monsieur Tarzan
is agreeable."
 
Tarzan nodded his head.
 
"But you are mad, my dear D'Arnot," he insisted.  "Those
little fingers are buried on the west coast of Africa."
 
"I do not know as to that, Tarzan," replied D'Arnot.  "It is
possible, but if you are not the son of John Clayton then how
in heaven's name did you come into that God forsaken jungle
where no white man other than John Clayton had ever set foot?"
 
"You forget--Kala," said Tarzan.
 
"I do not even consider her," replied D'Arnot.
 
The friends had walked to the broad window overlooking
the boulevard as they talked.  For some time they stood there
gazing out upon the busy throng beneath, each wrapped in
his own thoughts.
 
"It takes some time to compare finger prints," thought
D'Arnot, turning to look at the police officer.
 
To his astonishment he saw the official leaning back in his
chair hastily scanning the contents of the little black diary.
 
D'Arnot coughed.  The policeman looked up, and, catching his
eye, raised his finger to admonish silence.  D'Arnot turned
back to the window, and presently the police officer spoke.
 
"Gentlemen," he said.
 
Both turned toward him.
 
"There is evidently a great deal at stake which must hinge
to a greater or lesser extent upon the absolute correctness of
this comparison.  I therefore ask that you leave the entire
matter in my hands until Monsieur Desquerc, our expert
returns.  It will be but a matter of a few days."
 
"I had hoped to know at once," said D'Arnot.  "Monsieur
Tarzan sails for America tomorrow."
 
"I will promise that you can cable him a report within two
weeks," replied the officer; "but what it will be I dare not say.
There are resemblances, yet--well, we had better leave it for
Monsieur Desquerc to solve."
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
A taxicab drew up before an oldfashioned residence upon
the outskirts of Baltimore.
 
A man of about forty, well built and with strong, regular
features, stepped out, and paying the chauffeur dismissed him.
 
A moment later the passenger was entering the library of
the old home.
 
"Ah, Mr. Canler!" exclaimed an old man, rising to greet him.
 
"Good evening, my dear Professor," cried the man, extending
a cordial hand.
 
"Who admitted you?" asked the professor.
 
"Esmeralda."
 
"Then she will acquaint Jane with the fact that you are
here," said the old man.
 
"No, Professor," replied Canler, "for I came primarily to
see you."
 
"Ah, I am honored," said Professor Porter.
 
"Professor," continued Robert Canler, with great deliberation,
as though carefully weighing his words, "I have come
this evening to speak with you about Jane."
 
"You know my aspirations, and you have been generous
enough to approve my suit."
 
Professor Archimedes Q. Porter fidgeted in his armchair.
The subject always made him uncomfortable.  He could not
understand why.  Canler was a splendid match.
 
"But Jane," continued Canler, "I cannot understand her.
She puts me off first on one ground and then another.  I have
always the feeling that she breathes a sigh of relief every time
I bid her good-by."
 
"Tut, tut," said Professor Porter.  "Tut, tut, Mr. Canler.
Jane is a most obedient daughter.  She will do precisely as I
tell her."
 
"Then I can still count on your support?" asked Canler, a
tone of relief marking his voice.
 
"Certainly, sir; certainly, sir," exclaimed Professor Porter.
"How could you doubt it?"
 
"There is young Clayton, you know," suggested Canler. "He has
been hanging about for months.  I don't know that Jane cares
for him; but beside his title they say he has inherited a
very considerable estate from his father, and it might not be
strange,--if he finally won her, unless--" and Canler paused.
 
"Tut--tut, Mr. Canler; unless--what?"
 
"Unless, you see fit to request that Jane and I be married
at once," said Canler, slowly and distinctly.
 
"I have already suggested to Jane that it would be desirable,"
said Professor Porter sadly, "for we can no longer afford to
keep up this house, and live as her associations demand."
 
"What was her reply?" asked Canler.
 
"She said she was not ready to marry anyone yet," replied
Professor Porter, "and that we could go and live upon the
farm in northern Wisconsin which her mother left her.
 
"It is a little more than self-supporting.  The tenants have
always made a living from it, and been able to send Jane a
trifle beside, each year.  She is planning on our going up there
the first of the week.  Philander and Mr. Clayton have already
gone to get things in readiness for us."
 
"Clayton has gone there?" exclaimed Canler, visibly chagrined.
"Why was I not told?  I would gladly have gone and
seen that every comfort was provided."
 
"Jane feels that we are already too much in your debt, Mr.
Canler," said Professor Porter.
 
Canler was about to reply, when the sound of footsteps
came from the hall without, and Jane entered the room.
 
"Oh, I beg your pardon!" she exclaimed, pausing on the
threshold.  "I thought you were alone, papa."
 
"It is only I, Jane," said Canler, who had risen, "won't you
come in and join the family group?  We were just speaking of you."
 
"Thank you," said Jane, entering and taking the chair Canler
placed for her.  "I only wanted to tell papa that Tobey is
coming down from the college tomorrow to pack his books.  I
want you to be sure, papa, to indicate all that you can do
without until fall.  Please don't carry this entire library to
Wisconsin, as you would have carried it to Africa, if I had
not put my foot down."
 
"Was Tobey here?" asked Professor Porter.
 
"Yes, I just left him.  He and Esmeralda are exchanging
religious experiences on the back porch now."
 
"Tut, tut, I must see him at once!" cried the professor.
"Excuse me just a moment, children," and the old man
hastened from the room.
 
As soon as he was out of earshot Canler turned to Jane.
 
"See here, Jane," he said bluntly.  "How long is this thing
going on like this?  You haven't refused to marry me, but you
haven't promised either.  I want to get the license tomorrow,
so that we can be married quietly before you leave for Wisconsin.
I don't care for any fuss or feathers, and I'm sure you
don't either."
 
The girl turned cold, but she held her head bravely.
 
"Your father wishes it, you know," added Canler.
 
"Yes, I know."
 
She spoke scarcely above a whisper.
 
"Do you realize that you are buying me, Mr. Canler?" she
said finally, and in a cold, level voice.  "Buying me for a few
paltry dollars?  Of course you do, Robert Canler, and the
hope of just such a contingency was in your mind when you
loaned papa the money for that hair-brained escapade, which
but for a most mysterious circumstance would have been
surprisingly successful.
 
"But you, Mr. Canler, would have been the most surprised.
You had no idea that the venture would succeed.  You are too
good a businessman for that.  And you are too good a
businessman to loan money for buried treasure seeking, or to
loan money without security--unless you had some special
object in view.
 
"You knew that without security you had a greater hold on
the honor of the Porters than with it.  You knew the one best
way to force me to marry you, without seeming to force me.
 
"You have never mentioned the loan.  In any other man I
should have thought that the prompting of a magnanimous
and noble character.  But you are deep, Mr. Robert Canler.  I
know you better than you think I know you.
 
"I shall certainly marry you if there is no other way, but
let us understand each other once and for all."
 
While she spoke Robert Canler had alternately flushed and
paled, and when she ceased speaking he arose, and with a
cynical smile upon his strong face, said:
 
"You surprise me, Jane.  I thought you had more self-control
--more pride.  Of course you are right.  I am buying you,
and I knew that you knew it, but I thought you would prefer
to pretend that it was otherwise.  I should have thought your
self respect and your Porter pride would have shrunk from
admitting, even to yourself, that you were a bought woman.
But have it your own way, dear girl," he added lightly.  "I
am going to have you, and that is all that interests me."
 
Without a word the girl turned and left the room.
 
Jane was not married before she left with her father and
Esmeralda for her little Wisconsin farm, and as she coldly
bid Robert Canler goodby as her train pulled out, he called to
her that he would join them in a week or two.
 
At their destination they were met by Clayton and Mr.
Philander in a huge touring car belonging to the former, and
quickly whirled away through the dense northern woods toward
the little farm which the girl had not visited before
since childhood.
 
The farmhouse, which stood on a little elevation some
hundred yards from the tenant house, had undergone a complete
transformation during the three weeks that Clayton and
Mr. Philander had been there.
 
The former had imported a small army of carpenters and
plasterers, plumbers and painters from a distant city, and
what had been but a dilapidated shell when they reached it
was now a cosy little two-story house filled with every modern
convenience procurable in so short a time.
 
"Why, Mr. Clayton, what have you done?" cried Jane Porter,
her heart sinking within her as she realized the probable
size of the expenditure that had been made.
 
"S-sh," cautioned Clayton.  "Don't let your father guess.  If
you don't tell him he will never notice, and I simply couldn't
think of him living in the terrible squalor and sordidness
which Mr. Philander and I found.  It was so little when I
would like to do so much, Jane.  For his sake, please, never
mention it."
 
"But you know that we can't repay you," cried the girl.
"Why do you want to put me under such terrible obligations?"
 
"Don't, Jane," said Clayton sadly.  "If it had been just you,
believe me, I wouldn't have done it, for I knew from the start
that it would only hurt me in your eyes, but I couldn't think
of that dear old man living in the hole we found here.  Won't
you please believe that I did it just for him and give me that
little crumb of pleasure at least?"
 
"I do believe you, Mr. Clayton," said the girl, "because I
know you are big enough and generous enough to have done
it just for him--and, oh Cecil, I wish I might repay you as
you deserve--as you would wish."
 
"Why can't you, Jane?"
 
"Because I love another."
 
"Canler?"
 
"No."
 
"But you are going to marry him.  He told me as much
before I left Baltimore."
 
The girl winced.
 
"I do not love him," she said, almost proudly.
 
"Is it because of the money, Jane?"
 
She nodded.
 
"Then am I so much less desirable than Canler?  I have
money enough, and far more, for every need," he said bitterly.
 
"I do not love you, Cecil," she said, "but I respect you.  If I
must disgrace myself by such a bargain with any man, I prefer
that it be one I already despise.  I should loathe the man
to whom I sold myself without love, whomsoever he might
be.  You will be happier," she concluded, "alone--with my
respect and friendship, than with me and my contempt."
 
He did not press the matter further, but if ever a man had
murder in his heart it was William Cecil Clayton, Lord
Greystoke, when, a week later, Robert Canler drew up before
the farmhouse in his purring six cylinder.
 
A week passed; a tense, uneventful, but uncomfortable
week for all the inmates of the little Wisconsin farmhouse.
 
Canler was insistent that Jane marry him at once.
 
At length she gave in from sheer loathing of the continued
and hateful importuning.
 
It was agreed that on the morrow Canler was to drive to
town and bring back the license and a minister.
 
Clayton had wanted to leave as soon as the plan was
announced, but the girl's tired, hopeless look kept him.
He could not desert her.
 
Something might happen yet, he tried to console himself
by thinking.  And in his heart, he knew that it would require
but a tiny spark to turn his hatred for Canler into the blood
lust of the killer.
 
Early the next morning Canler set out for town.
 
In the east smoke could be seen lying low over the forest,
for a fire had been raging for a week not far from them, but
the wind still lay in the west and no danger threatened them.
 
About noon Jane started off for a walk.  She would not let
Clayton accompany her.  She wanted to be alone, she said,
and he respected her wishes.
 
In the house Professor Porter and Mr. Philander were immersed
in an absorbing discussion of some weighty scientific problem.
Esmeralda dozed in the kitchen, and Clayton, heavy-eyed after
a sleepless night, threw himself down upon the couch in the
living room and soon dropped into a fitful slumber.
 
To the east the black smoke clouds rose higher into the
heavens, suddenly they eddied, and then commenced to drift
rapidly toward the west.
 
On and on they came.  The inmates of the tenant house
were gone, for it was market day, and none was there to
see the rapid approach of the fiery demon.
 
Soon the flames had spanned the road to the south and cut
off Canler's return.  A little fluctuation of the wind now
carried the path of the forest fire to the north, then blew back
and the flames nearly stood still as though held in leash by
some master hand.
 
Suddenly, out of the northeast, a great black car came
careening down the road.
 
With a jolt it stopped before the cottage, and a black-haired
giant leaped out to run up onto the porch.  Without a
pause he rushed into the house.  On the couch lay Clayton.
The man started in surprise, but with a bound was at the side
of the sleeping man.
 
Shaking him roughly by the shoulder, he cried:
 
"My God, Clayton, are you all mad here?  Don't you know
you are nearly surrounded by fire?  Where is Miss Porter?"
 
Clayton sprang to his feet.  He did not recognize the man,
but he understood the words and was upon the veranda in a bound.
 
"Scott!" he cried, and then, dashing back into the house,
"Jane!  Jane! where are you?"
 
In an instant Esmeralda, Professor Porter and Mr. Philander
had joined the two men.
 
"Where is Miss Jane?" cried Clayton, seizing Esmeralda by
the shoulders and shaking her roughly.
 
"Oh, Gaberelle, Mister Clayton, she done gone for a walk."
 
"Hasn't she come back yet?" and, without waiting for a reply,
Clayton dashed out into the yard, followed by the others.
"Which way did she go?" cried the black-haired giant of Esmeralda.
 
"Down that road," cried the frightened woman, pointing
toward the south where a mighty wall of roaring flames shut
out the view.
 
"Put these people in the other car," shouted the stranger to
Clayton.  "I saw one as I drove up--and get them out of here
by the north road.
 
"Leave my car here.  If I find Miss Porter we shall need it.
If I don't, no one will need it.  Do as I say," as Clayton
hesitated, and then they saw the lithe figure bound away cross
the clearing toward the northwest where the forest still stood,
untouched by flame.
 
In each rose the unaccountable feeling that a great
responsibility had been raised from their shoulders; a kind
of implicit confidence in the power of the stranger to save
Jane if she could be saved.
 
"Who was that?" asked Professor Porter.
 
"I do not know," replied Clayton.  "He called me by name
and he knew Jane, for he asked for her.  And he called
Esmeralda by name."
 
"There was something most startlingly familiar about him,"
exclaimed Mr. Philander, "And yet, bless me, I know I never
saw him before."
 
"Tut, tut!" cried Professor Porter.  "Most remarkable!
Who could it have been, and why do I feel that Jane is safe,
now that he has set out in search of her?"
 
"I can't tell you, Professor," said Clayton soberly, "but I
know I have the same uncanny feeling."
 
"But come," he cried, "we must get out of here ourselves,
or we shall be shut off," and the party hastened toward
Clayton's car.
 
When Jane turned to retrace her steps homeward, she was
alarmed to note how near the smoke of the forest fire
seemed, and as she hastened onward her alarm became almost
a panic when she perceived that the rushing flames were
rapidly forcing their way between herself and the cottage.
 
At length she was compelled to turn into the dense thicket
and attempt to force her way to the west in an effort to circle
around the flames and reach the house.
 
In a short time the futility of her attempt became apparent
and then her one hope lay in retracing her steps to the road
and flying for her life to the south toward the town.
 
The twenty minutes that it took her to regain the road was
all that had been needed to cut off her retreat as effectually as
her advance had been cut off before.
 
A short run down the road brought her to a horrified
stand, for there before her was another wall of flame.  An
arm of the main conflagration had shot out a half mile south
of its parent to embrace this tiny strip of road in its
implacable clutches.
 
Jane knew that it was useless again to attempt to force her
way through the undergrowth.
 
She had tried it once, and failed.  Now she realized that it
would be but a matter of minutes ere the whole space between
the north and the south would be a seething mass of
billowing flames.
 
Calmly the girl kneeled down in the dust of the roadway
and prayed for strength to meet her fate bravely, and for the
delivery of her father and her friends from death.
 
Suddenly she heard her name being called aloud through
the forest:
 
"Jane!  Jane Porter!"  It rang strong and clear, but in a
strange voice.
 
"Here!" she called in reply.  "Here!  In the roadway!"
 
Then through the branches of the trees she saw a figure
swinging with the speed of a squirrel.
 
A veering of the wind blew a cloud of smoke about them
and she could no longer see the man who was speeding toward
her, but suddenly she felt a great arm about her.  Then
she was lifted up, and she felt the rushing of the wind and
the occasional brush of a branch as she was borne along.
 
She opened her eyes.
 
Far below her lay the undergrowth and the hard earth.
 
About her was the waving foliage of the forest.
 
From tree to tree swung the giant figure which bore her,
and it seemed to Jane that she was living over in a dream the
experience that had been hers in that far African jungle.
 
Oh, if it were but the same man who had borne her so
swiftly through the tangled verdure on that other day! but
that was impossible!  Yet who else in all the world was there
with the strength and agility to do what this man was now doing?
 
She stole a sudden glance at the face close to hers, and
then she gave a little frightened gasp.  It was he!
 
"My forest man!" she murmured, "No, I must be delerious!"
 
"Yes, your man, Jane Porter.  Your savage, primeval man
come out of the jungle to claim his mate--the woman who
ran away from him," he added almost fiercely.
 
"I did not run away," she whispered.  "I would only consent
to leave when they had waited a week for you to return."
 
They had come to a point beyond the fire now, and he had
turned back to the clearing.
 
Side by side they were walking toward the cottage.  The
wind had changed once more and the fire was burning back
upon itself--another hour like that and it would be burned out.
 
"Why did you not return?" she asked.
 
"I was nursing D'Arnot.  He was badly wounded."
 
"Ah, I knew it!" she exclaimed.
 
"They said you had gone to join the blacks--that they
were your people."
 
He laughed.
 
"But you did not believe them, Jane?"
 
"No;--what shall I call you?" she asked.  "What is your name?"
 
"I was Tarzan of the Apes when you first knew me," he said.
 
"Tarzan of the Apes!" she cried--"and that was your note
I answered when I left?"
 
"Yes, whose did you think it was?"
 
"I did not know; only that it could not be yours, for Tarzan
of the Apes had written in English, and you could not
understand a word of any language."
 
Again he laughed.
 
"It is a long story, but it was I who wrote what I could not
speak--and now D'Arnot has made matters worse by teaching
me to speak French instead of English.
 
"Come," he added, "jump into my car, we must overtake
your father, they are only a little way ahead."
 
As they drove along, he said:
 
"Then when you said in your note to Tarzan of the Apes
that you loved another--you might have meant me?"
 
"I might have," she answered, simply.
 
"But in Baltimore--Oh, how I have searched for you--they
told me you would possibly be married by now.  That a
man named Canler had come up here to wed you.  Is that true?"
 
"Yes."
 
"Do you love him?"
 
"No."
 
"Do you love me?"
 
She buried her face in her hands.
 
"I am promised to another.  I cannot answer you, Tarzan
of the Apes," she cried.
 
"You have answered.  Now, tell me why you would marry
one you do not love."
 
"My father owes him money."
 
Suddenly there came back to Tarzan the memory of the
letter he had read--and the name Robert Canler and the
hinted trouble which he had been unable to understand then.
 
He smiled.
 
"If your father had not lost the treasure you would not feel
forced to keep your promise to this man Canler?"
 
"I could ask him to release me."
 
"And if he refused?"
 
"I have given my promise."
 
He was silent for a moment.  The car was plunging along the
uneven road at a reckless pace, for the fire showed threateningly
at their right, and another change of the wind might sweep it
on with raging fury across this one avenue of escape.
 
Finally they passed the danger point, and Tarzan reduced
their speed.
 
"Suppose I should ask him?" ventured Tarzan.
 
"He would scarcely accede to the demand of a stranger,"
said the girl.  "Especially one who wanted me himself."
 
"Terkoz did," said Tarzan, grimly.
 
Jane shuddered and looked fearfully up at the giant figure
beside her, for she knew that he meant the great anthropoid
he had killed in her defense.
 
"This is not the African jungle," she said.  "You are no
longer a savage beast.  You are a gentleman, and gentlemen
do not kill in cold blood."
 
"I am still a wild beast at heart," he said, in a low voice,
as though to himself.
 
Again they were silent for a time.
 
"Jane," said the man, at length, "if you were free, would
you marry me?"
 
She did not reply at once, but he waited patiently.
 
The girl was trying to collect her thoughts.
 
What did she know of this strange creature at her side?
What did he know of himself?  Who was he?  Who, his parents?
 
Why, his very name echoed his mysterious origin and his
savage life.
 
He had no name.  Could she be happy with this jungle
waif?  Could she find anything in common with a husband
whose life had been spent in the tree tops of an African
wilderness, frolicking and fighting with fierce anthropoids;
tearing his food from the quivering flank of fresh-killed prey,
sinking his strong teeth into raw flesh, and tearing away his
portion while his mates growled and fought about him for
their share?
 
Could he ever rise to her social sphere?  Could she bear to
think of sinking to his?  Would either be happy in such a
horrible misalliance?
 
"You do not answer," he said.  "Do you shrink from
wounding me?"
 
"I do not know what answer to make," said Jane sadly.  "I
do not know my own mind."
 
"You do not love me, then?" he asked, in a level tone.
 
"Do not ask me.  You will be happier without me.  You
were never meant for the formal restrictions and
conventionalities of society--civilization would become
irksome to you, and in a little while you would long for the
freedom of your old life--a life to which I am as totally
unfitted as you to mine."
 
"I think I understand you," he replied quietly.  "I shall not
urge you, for I would rather see you happy than to be happy
myself.  I see now that you could not be happy with--an ape."
 
There was just the faintest tinge of bitterness in his voice.
 
"Don't," she remonstrated.  "Don't say that.  You do not
understand."
 
But before she could go on a sudden turn in the road
brought them into the midst of a little hamlet.
 
Before them stood Clayton's car surrounded by the party
he had brought from the cottage.
 
 
 &nbsp;  
 
 
At the sight of Jane, cries of relief and delight broke from
every lip, and as Tarzan's car stopped beside the other,
Professor Porter caught his daughter in his arms.
 
For a moment no one noticed Tarzan, sitting silently in his seat.
 
Clayton was the first to remember, and, turning, held out
his hand.
 
"How can we ever thank you?" he exclaimed.  "You have
saved us all.  You called me by name at the cottage, but I do
not seem to recall yours, though there is something very
familiar about you.  It is as though I had known you well under
very different conditions a long time ago."
 
Tarzan smiled as he took the proffered hand.
 
"You are quite right, Monsieur Clayton," he said, in French.
"You will pardon me if I do not speak to you in English.
I am just learning it, and while I understand it fairly
well I speak it very poorly."
 
"But who are you?" insisted Clayton, speaking in French
this time himself.
 
"Tarzan of the Apes."
 
Clayton started back in surprise.
 
"By Jove!" he exclaimed.  "It is true."
 
And Professor Porter and Mr. Philander pressed forward to add
their thanks to Clayton's, and to voice their surprise and
pleasure at seeing their jungle friend so far from his savage home.
 
The party now entered the modest little hostelry, where
Clayton soon made arrangements for their entertainment.
 
They were sitting in the little, stuffy parlor when the distant
chugging of an approaching automobile caught their attention.
 
Mr. Philander, who was sitting near the window, looked
out as the car drew in sight, finally stopping beside
the other automobiles.
 
"Bless me!" said Mr. Philander, a shade of annoyance in
his tone.  "It is Mr. Canler.  I had hoped, er--I had thought
or--er--how very happy we should be that he was not caught
in the fire," he ended lamely.
 
"Tut, tut!  Mr. Philander," said Professor Porter.  "Tut,
tut!  I have often admonished my pupils to count ten before
speaking.  Were I you, Mr. Philander, I should count at least a
thousand, and then maintain a discreet silence."
 
"Bless me, yes!" acquiesced Mr. Philander.  "But who is the
clerical appearing gentleman with him?"
 
Jane blanched.
 
Clayton moved uneasily in his chair.
 
Professor Porter removed his spectacles nervously, and breathed
upon them, but replaced them on his nose without wiping.
 
The ubiquitous Esmeralda grunted.
 
Only Tarzan did not comprehend.
 
Presently Robert Canler burst into the room.
 
"Thank God!" he cried.  "I feared the worst, until I saw
your car, Clayton.  I was cut off on the south road and had to
go away back to town, and then strike east to this road.  I
thought we'd never reach the cottage."
 
No one seemed to enthuse much.  Tarzan eyed Robert Canler
as Sabor eyes her prey.
 
Jane glanced at him and coughed nervously.
 
"Mr. Canler," she said, "this is Monsieur Tarzan, an old friend."
 
Canler turned and extended his hand.  Tarzan rose and
bowed as only D'Arnot could have taught a gentleman to do
it, but he did not seem to see Canler's hand.
 
Nor did Canler appear to notice the oversight.
 
"This is the Reverend Mr. Tousley, Jane," said Canler, turning
to the clerical party behind him.  "Mr. Tousley, Miss Porter."
 
Mr. Tousley bowed and beamed.
 
Canler introduced him to the others.
 
"We can have the ceremony at once, Jane," said Canler.
"Then you and I can catch the midnight train in town."
 
Tarzan understood the plan instantly.  He glanced out of
half-closed eyes at Jane, but he did not move.
 
The girl hesitated.  The room was tense with the silence of
taut nerves.
 
All eyes turned toward Jane, awaiting her reply.
 
"Can't we wait a few days?" she asked.  "I am all unstrung.
I have been through so much today."
 
Canler felt the hostility that emanated from each member
of the party.  It made him angry.
 
"We have waited as long as I intend to wait," he said
roughly.  "You have promised to marry me.  I shall be played
with no longer.  I have the license and here is the preacher.
Come Mr. Tousley; come Jane.  There are plenty of witnesses
--more than enough," he added with a disagreeable inflection;
and taking Jane Porter by the arm, he started to lead
her toward the waiting minister.
 
But scarcely had he taken a single step ere a heavy hand
closed upon his arm with a grip of steel.
 
Another hand shot to his throat and in a moment he was being
shaken high above the floor, as a cat might shake a mouse.
 
Jane turned in horrified surprise toward Tarzan.
 
And, as she looked into his face, she saw the crimson band
upon his forehead that she had seen that other day in far
distant Africa, when Tarzan of the Apes had closed in mortal
combat with the great anthropoid--Terkoz.
 
She knew that murder lay in that savage heart, and with a little
cry of horror she sprang forward to plead with the ape-man.
 But her fears were more for Tarzan than for Canler.  She
realized the stern retribution which justice metes to the murderer.
 
Before she could reach them, however, Clayton had
jumped to Tarzan's side and attempted to drag Canler from
his grasp.
 
With a single sweep of one mighty arm the Englishman
was hurled across the room, and then Jane laid a firm white
hand upon Tarzan's wrist, and looked up into his eyes.
 
"For my sake," she said.
 
The grasp upon Canler's throat relaxed.
 
Tarzan looked down into the beautiful face before him.
 
"Do you wish this to live?" he asked in surprise.
 
"I do not wish him to die at your hands, my friend," she
replied.  "I do not wish you to become a murderer."
 
Tarzan removed his hand from Canler's throat.
 
"Do you release her from her promise?" he asked.  "It is
the price of your life."
 
Canler, gasping for breath, nodded.
 
"Will you go away and never molest her further?"
 
Again the man nodded his head, his face distorted by fear
of the death that had been so close.
 
Tarzan released him, and Canler staggered toward the
door.  In another moment he was gone, and the terror-
stricken preacher with him.
 
Tarzan turned toward Jane.
 
"May I speak with you for a moment, alone," he asked.
 
The girl nodded and started toward the door leading to the
narrow veranda of the little hotel.  She passed out to await
Tarzan and so did not hear the conversation which followed.
 
"Wait," cried Professor Porter, as Tarzan was about to follow.
 
The professor had been stricken dumb with surprise by the
rapid developments of the past few minutes.
 
"Before we go further, sir, I should like an explanation of
the events which have just transpired.  By what right, sir, did
you interfere between my daughter and Mr. Canler?  I had
promised him her hand, sir, and regardless of our personal
likes or dislikes, sir, that promise must be kept."
 
"I interfered, Professor Porter," replied Tarzan, "because
your daughter does not love Mr. Canler--she does not wish
to marry him.  That is enough for me to know."
 
"You do not know what you have done," said Professor
Porter.  "Now he will doubtless refuse to marry her."
 
"He most certainly will," said Tarzan, emphatically.
 
"And further," added Tarzan, "you need not fear that your
pride will suffer, Professor Porter, for you will be able to pay
the Canler person what you owe him the moment you reach home."
 
"Tut, tut, sir!" exclaimed Professor Porter.  "What do you
mean, sir?"
 
"Your treasure has been found," said Tarzan.
 
"What--what is that you are saying?" cried the professor.
"You are mad, man.  It cannot be."
 
"It is, though.  It was I who stole it, not knowing either its
value or to whom it belonged.  I saw the sailors bury it, and,
ape-like, I had to dig it up and bury it again elsewhere.  When
D'Arnot told me what it was and what it meant to you I returned
to the jungle and recovered it.  It had caused so much
crime and suffering and sorrow that D'Arnot thought it best
not to attempt to bring the treasure itself on here, as had
been my intention, so I have brought a letter of credit instead.
 
"Here it is, Professor Porter," and Tarzan drew an envelope
from his pocket and handed it to the astonished professor,
"two hundred and forty-one thousand dollars.  The treasure
was most carefully appraised by experts, but lest there
should be any question in your mind, D'Arnot himself bought
it and is holding it for you, should you prefer the treasure
to the credit."
 
"To the already great burden of the obligations we owe you,
sir," said Professor Porter, with trembling voice, "is now
added this greatest of all services.  You have given me the
means to save my honor."
 
Clayton, who had left the room a moment after Canler,
now returned.
 
"Pardon me," he said.  "I think we had better try to reach
town before dark and take the first train out of this forest.  A
native just rode by from the north, who reports that the fire
is moving slowly in this direction."
 
This announcement broke up further conversation, and the
entire party went out to the waiting automobiles.
 
Clayton, with Jane, the professor and Esmeralda occupied
Clayton's car, while Tarzan took Mr. Philander in with him.
 
"Bless me!" exclaimed Mr. Philander, as the car moved off
after Clayton.  "Who would ever have thought it possible!  The
last time I saw you you were a veritable wild man, skipping
about among the branches of a tropical African forest, and
now you are driving me along a Wisconsin road in a French
automobile.  Bless me!  But it is most remarkable."
 
"Yes," assented Tarzan, and then, after a pause, "Mr. Philander,
do you recall any of the details of the finding and burying of
three skeletons found in my cabin beside that African jungle?"
 
"Very distinctly, sir, very distinctly," replied Mr. Philander.
 
"Was there anything peculiar about any of those skeletons?"
 
Mr. Philander eyed Tarzan narrowly.
 
"Why do you ask?"
 
"It means a great deal to me to know," replied Tarzan.
"Your answer may clear up a mystery.  It can do no worse, at
any rate, than to leave it still a mystery.  I have been
entertaining a theory concerning those skeletons for the past
two months, and I want you to answer my question to the best of
your knowledge--were the three skeletons you buried all
human skeletons?"
 
"No," said Mr. Philander, "the smallest one, the one found
in the crib, was the skeleton of an anthropoid ape."
 
"Thank you," said Tarzan.
 
In the car ahead, Jane was thinking fast and furiously.  She
had felt the purpose for which Tarzan had asked a few words
with her, and she knew that she must be prepared to give
him an answer in the very near future.
 
He was not the sort of person one could put off, and somehow
that very thought made her wonder if she did not really
fear him.
 
And could she love where she feared?
 
She realized the spell that had been upon her in the depths
of that far-off jungle, but there was no spell of enchantment
now in prosaic Wisconsin.
 
Nor did the immaculate young Frenchman appeal to the
primal woman in her, as had the stalwart forest god.
 
Did she love him?  She did not know--now.
 
She glanced at Clayton out of the corner of her eye.  Was
not here a man trained in the same school of environment in
which she had been trained--a man with social position and
culture such as she had been taught to consider as the prime
essentials to congenial association?
 
Did not her best judgment point to this young English nobleman,
whose love she knew to be of the sort a civilized woman
should crave, as the logical mate for such as herself?
 
Could she love Clayton?  She could see no reason why she
could not.  Jane was not coldly calculating by nature, but
training, environment and heredity had all combined to teach
her to reason even in matters of the heart.
 
That she had been carried off her feet by the strength of
the young giant when his great arms were about her in the
distant African forest, and again today, in the Wisconsin
woods, seemed to her only attributable to a temporary mental
reversion to type on her part--to the psychological appeal of
the primeval man to the primeval woman in her nature.
 
If he should never touch her again, she reasoned, she would
never feel attracted toward him.  She had not loved him, then.
It had been nothing more than a passing hallucination,
super-induced by excitement and by personal contact.
 
Excitement would not always mark their future relations,
should she marry him, and the power of personal contact
eventually would be dulled by familiarity.
 
Again she glanced at Clayton.  He was very handsome and every
inch a gentleman.  She should be very proud of such a husband.
 
And then he spoke--a minute sooner or a minute later might
have made all the difference in the world to three lives
--but chance stepped in and pointed out to Clayton the
psychological moment.
 
"You are free now, Jane," he said.  "Won't you say yes--I
will devote my life to making you very happy."
 
"Yes," she whispered.
 
That evening in the little waiting room at the station Tarzan
caught Jane alone for a moment.
 
"You are free now, Jane," he said, "and _I_ have come
across the ages out of the dim and distant past from the lair
of the primeval man to claim you--for your sake I have become
a civilized man--for your sake I have crossed oceans
and continents--for your sake I will be whatever you will me
to be.  I can make you happy, Jane, in the life you know and
love best.  Will you marry me?"
 
For the first time she realized the depths of the man's love
--all that he had accomplished in so short a time solely for
love of her.  Turning her head she buried her face in her arms.
 
What had she done?  Because she had been afraid she
might succumb to the pleas of this giant, she had burned her
bridges behind her--in her groundless apprehension that she
might make a terrible mistake, she had made a worse one.
 
And then she told him all--told him the truth word by word,
without attempting to shield herself or condone her error.
 
"What can we do?" he asked.  "You have admitted that you
love me.  You know that I love you; but I do not know the
ethics of society by which you are governed.  I shall leave the
decision to you, for you know best what will be for your
eventual welfare."
 
"I cannot tell him, Tarzan," she said.  "He too, loves me,
and he is a good man.  I could never face you nor any other
honest person if I repudiated my promise to Mr. Clayton.  I
shall have to keep it--and you must help me bear the burden,
though we may not see each other again after tonight."
 
The others were entering the room now and Tarzan turned
toward the little window.
 
But he saw nothing outside--within he saw a patch of
greensward surrounded by a matted mass of gorgeous tropical
plants and flowers, and, above, the waving foliage of
mighty trees, and, over all, the blue of an equatorial sky.
 
In the center of the greensward a young woman sat upon a
little mound of earth, and beside her sat a young giant.
They ate pleasant fruit and looked into each other's eyes and
smiled.  They were very happy, and they were all alone.
 
His thoughts were broken in upon by the station agent who
entered asking if there was a gentleman by the name of Tarzan
in the party.
 
"I am Monsieur Tarzan," said the ape-man.
 
"Here is a message for you, forwarded from Baltimore; it
is a cablegram from Paris."
 
Tarzan took the envelope and tore it open.  The message
was from D'Arnot.
 
It read:
 
 
Fingerprints prove you Greystoke.  Congratulations.
                                      D'ARNOT.
 
 
As Tarzan finished reading, Clayton entered and came toward
him with extended hand.
 
Here was the man who had Tarzan's title, and Tarzan's estates,
and was going to marry the woman whom Tarzan loved--the
woman who loved Tarzan.  A single word from Tarzan would
make a great difference in this man's life.
 
It would take away his title and his lands and his castles,
and--it would take them away from Jane Porter also.
"I say, old man," cried Clayton, "I haven't had a chance to
thank you for all you've done for us.  It seems as though you
had your hands full saving our lives in Africa and here.
 
"I'm awfully glad you came on here.  We must get better
acquainted.  I often thought about you, you know, and the
remarkable circumstances of your environment.
 
"If it's any of my business, how the devil did you ever get
into that bally jungle?"
 
"I was born there," said Tarzan, quietly.  "My mother was
an Ape, and of course she couldn't tell me much about it.
I never knew who my father was."
