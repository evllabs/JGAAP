Paper #1 

A New Era

	Adventurous, risky, hopeful, and mysterious, are all words to describe the frontier to people who wanted a change in the way they lived.  In the past, people physically traveled hundreds of miles to discover the unknown. Today, however, people not only read books and watch movies to rediscover the western frontier, but also create a new era of frontiers by exploring space, the ocean, and cyberspace.  
	Even decades after the west has been settled and civilized, people continue to read, watch movies, and even travel to places that replicate the western frontier.  Adventurers, such as Daniel Boone, have captured the lives of many who seek for an exploration of the unsettled and the unknown.  By reading and watching movies of this great settler, many could escape the reality of work, laws, and civilization. As a result, one could become part of a society that was independent, unpredictable, and mysterious. 
	Hollywood, has kept generations longing to experience the excitement of the western frontier.  Actors, such as John Wayne, have also kept the western frontier living and entering the lives of people all over the world. The movie “Dances with Wolves,” is another example of the western frontier, and the relationship between Native Americans and the settlers.  Although a lot of the content in movies and even books are exaggerated or completely fictional, people still flock to see and read about the adventures. 
        Space exploration has kept people intrigued about life beyond Earth for years.  Although a small percentage of the world’s population physically explores space, we all find ourselves seeking out information on space and space travel.  We also find ourselves looking up at the sky and wondering what really is in space.  Starting with man orbiting the Earth and landing on the moon, this frontier has now grown to the exploration of Mars.  Also, in recent years, the idea of making a livable civilization on the moon has been formed. Decades have passed; yet people have not been satisfied with what researchers have already discovered.  People want more, and people want answers because they are drawn to places and objects that are foreign to them. Thoughts of extraterrestrial life and possible medical discoveries fuel the curiosity of many which forces space exploration to persist.  
        Another frontier that has lasted for decades is oceanic exploration.  This frontier has grown from basic, unspecialized exploration to highly technical and detailed exploration.  Learning the number of oceans and how to predict the tides were the first of many discoveries made.  Later on, in oceanic exploration, was the examination of the animals and some plant life. Presently, researchers not only continue to study the tides, the animals, and the plant life, but they also study microorganisms, water quality, and surface water compared to deep water.  Reasons for this type of detailed exploration are powered by the ideas of the unknown, the hope of medical discoveries, and for personal satisfaction. 
        Shopping for a gift, banking, reading, and writing to others can now be done in the comforts of one’s own home due to the newest and most technologically advanced frontier: cyberspace. Unlike the oceans, and space, cyberspace did not already exist; it was invented by man.  The internet first started solely with email; now, every store, business, and school has a website and email address.  One can access information on almost any topic imaginable whether it’s for school, research, or for personal purposes.  Besides being able to do daily activities online, cyberspace has environmental benefits as well.  An example of a benefit is the conservation of the forests.  Many people, including myself, send emails rather than letters to communicate.  Even though cyberspace can cause many virus’ and lots of frustration due to technicalities, it is one of the most sought out frontiers because of its endless possibilities.  
        In spite of the fact that the western frontier has come to a close, many other frontiers have replaced it in order to satisfy man’s desire to learn and discover new places.  Space, oceanic, and cyberspace exploration are just some of the few frontiers that exist today.  These frontiers uphold to man’s expectations of adventure, risk, hope, and mystery.  Fueled by curiosity and the unknown, man will continue to conquer and discover new frontiers such as space, the oceans, and cyberspace.
