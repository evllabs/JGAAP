To Ser John Paston. 
I grete you wele and send you Goddes blissyng and myn, thankyng 
you for my seall that ye sent me; but I am right sory that ye dede so 
grete cost &thorn;er-vp-on, for on of xl d. shuld haue serued me right 
wele. Send me word what it cost you and I shall send you money 
there-fore. I send you a letter be a man of Yarmoth. Send me word if ye 
haue it, for I marveyll ye sent me non answere there-of be Juddy. I haue 
non very knowleche of your ensuraunce, but if ye be ensured I pray God 
send you joy and wurchep to-geder, and so I trost ye shull haue if it be 
as it is reported of here. And a-nemps God ye arn as gretly bownd to 
here as ye were maried; and &thorn;erfore I charge you vp-on my 
blissyng that ye be as trew to here as she were maried on-to you in all 
degrees, and ye shall haue the more grace and the better spede in all 
othere thynges. Also I wuld &thorn;at ye shuld not be to hasty to be 
maried till ye were more suere of your lyvelode, for ye must remembre 
what charge ye shall haue, and if ye haue not to mayntene it, it wull be a 
gret rebuke; and therfore labour that ye may haue releses of the lordes 
and be in more suert&eacute; of your lond or than ye be maried. The 
Duchesse of Suffolk is at Ewhelm in Oxford-shire, and it is thought be 
your frendes here that it is do &thorn;at she myght be ferre and ought of 
the  
wey, and &thorn;e rathere feyne excuse be-cause of age or sikenesse if 
&thorn;at the Kyng wuld send for here for your materes. Your elmyse 
be as bold here as thei were before, wherfore I can not thynk but that 
thei haue summe comfort. I sent to Cayster that thei shuld be ware in 
kepyng of &thorn;e place, as ye dede wright to me. Hast you to spede 
your materes as spedily as ye can, that ye may haue lesse felesship at 
Cayster, for the exspences and costes be grete and ye haue no nede 
&thorn;er-of and ye remembre you wele what charges ye haue beside 
and how your liffelode is dispoyled and wasted be your aduersaries. Also 
I wuld ye shuld purvey for your suster to be wyth my lady of Oxford or 
wyth my lady of Bedford or in summe othere wurchepfull place where as 
ye thynk best, and I wull help to here fyndyng, for we be eythere of vs 
wery of othere. I shall telle you more whan I speke wyth you. I pray you 
do your deveyre here-in as ye wull my comfort and welefare and your 
wurchep, for diuerse causes which ye shall vnderstand afterward, 
&amp;c. I spake wyth the Lord Skales at Norwich, and thanked hym for 
the good lordshep that he had shewed to you, and desired his lordshep to 
be your contynuall good lord. And he swore be his trought he wold do 
that he myght do for you, and he told me that Yeluerton the justice had 
spoke to hym in your matere, but he told me not what; but I trow and ye 
desired hym to telle you, he wuld. Ye arn beholdyng to my lord of his 
good report of you in this contr&eacute;, for he reported better of you 
than I trow ye deserue. I felt be hym that there hath be profered hym 
large proferes on your aduersaries parte ageyn you. Send me word as 
hastly as ye may after the begynnyng of the terme how ye haue sped in 
all your materes, for I shall thynk right long till I here summe good 
tidynges. Item, I pray you recomaund me to the good mayster that 
ye gaffe to the chapell of Cayster, and thank hym for the gret cost that 
he dede on me at Norwich; and if I were a grette lady he shuld 
vnderstand that he shuld fare the better fore me, for me semyth be his 
demenyng he shuld be right a good man. Item, I send you the 
nowche wyth the dyamaunth be the berere here-of. I pray yow fore-gete 
not to send me a kersche of cremelle fore nekkerchys fore yowr syster 
Anne, for I am schente of &thorn;e good lady &thorn;at sche is wyth 
be-cawse sche hathe non, and I can non gette in alle thys towne. I xuld 
wrythe more to yow but fore lakke of leysere. God haue yow in hys 
kepyng and send yow good spede in alle yowr materes. Wretyn in haste
