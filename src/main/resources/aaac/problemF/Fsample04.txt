  
To my ryght wyrsh[y]pfull husbond John Paston be thys delyueryd 
in hast. 
Ryght wyrshypfull hosbond, I recomaund me to you. Please it you 
to wyte that the same Wensday that Richard Call departyd hens I send 
Richard Charlys to speke wyth the vndershyrf, requyryng hym that he 
shold serue the replevyn for the shype and hors that were take, &amp;c.; 
and the shyrf sayd playnly that he wolnot nor derst not serue it, not 
thogh I wold yeve hym xx li. to serue it. And Richard Charlys axhyd the 
cause why, and he sayd for he woldnot haue to doo wyth that felshyp; 
and so it ys yet vnservyd. I suppose that Richard Calle hath told you 
what revell ther was by the  
bayllyf of Coshay and hys felaw vppon youre men that shold haue seruyd 
the replevyn. Item, the same Wensday that Richard Call rode 
from hens the[r] were endytyd v of [youre] men by the enquest of 
Fovrhoo hundere, as Crome can enforme you. And on Fryday last paste 
John Paston [[t]]he yongere, Wykys, and Thomas Honeworth were 
endytyd at Dyram, by what menys the berour herof, Crom, shall 
[[en]]forme you. I send thedere Richard Charlys, John Seve, and iij or 
iiij othere gode felows for to haue don othere folkys as gode a torne, but 
it wold not be for the juge ys soo parcyall wyth the othere party that I 
trowe there shalbe sped no maters be-fore hym for you nor for non of 
yourys tyl it be otherwyse by-twene you than it ys. Crom shall tell you 
of hys demenyng at the last sessyons at Dyrham. I send you a copy of 
both the endytementys. Youre son John Paston the yonger I hope shal be 
wyth you thys wyke, and enforme you of mo thyngys, and howe myn 
hors and hys sadell and harnys ys prysoner at Coshay halle, and haue 
ben euer syn Wensday last. Item, I recevyd a lettere from you on 
Satorday last whych was wryten on Monday next be-fore, and I haue 
sent to Ser Thomas Howys the same day for such maters as ye wrote to 
me of, and he sent me word that Wyllyam Worceter had a boke of 
remembraunce of recaytys that hath be recevyd by Ser John Fastolf or 
any of hys sythen the iiijte yere [of] Kyng Harry both of hys awyn 
lyflode or of any othere mannys that he had to doo wyth all. He sayd yf 
ye wold send to Wyll Worcetere to loke therfore he sayd he wyst well he 
wold lete you haue knowlych yf any such thyng may be founde; and also 
he sayd that he wold send  to the seyd Wyll to serche therfore. And as 
for such bokys as he hath hyre at hom, he wol doo loke yf any 
remembraunce canne be founde therof, and ye shall haue knowlych 
therof as he hath promysyd by Satourday next comyng. And as for the 
woman that made the clayme that ye wrote of, he ys wellwyllyd that she 
shold be seyn to in the way of almys, and, as I here say, it symyth by 
hym that in any thyng that he canne doo tochyng the savacyon of the 
dedys gode, othere in lyflode othere in othere godys, he sayth that he 
wyll doo. I canne not haue no knowlych that Haydon mellyth in the 
matere of Drayton. Yf he do oght therin he doyth it closely, as he ys 
wont to doo, and wayshyth hys hondys therof as Pylate dyde. It shalnot 
be long to or that I send to you of such tythyngys as we haue; I shall lete 
you haue knowlych therof. I fynd Crom ryght welwyllyng to you in such 
thyngys as lyth in hym for to do. I pray you lete hym be thankyd 
therfore, and that shall cause hym to be the betere wyllyd. He hath not 
be rewardyd as yet but by Richard Call, as he canne tell you.  
 
The blyssyd Trynyt&eacute; haue you in hys kypyng and send you gode 
spyde in al youre maters. Wryten in hast on Mydsomer Day. As for 
Rysyng, but yf ye purvey for hym he canne no helpe haue at home. By 
yourys,
