Item, I lete yow weet &thorn;at Plattyng is comen hyddre, and he 
seythe &thorn;at ye gaffe hym leve to fetche hys geere and Pittys, and 
that is hys erande hyddre and noon othere; nere he thowt neuer to goo 
fro me, nere he wyll nott goo fro me, as he seythe. Wherffor I praye 
yow sende me worde off hys condycions, and whyghe ye thynke 
&thorn;at he sholde neuer do me worshypp. He seythe also &thorn;at he
