  
To Master John Paston, or to my mestresse hys moodre, be thys 
letter delyueryd in hast. 
Brother, I comand me to yow, prayng yow &thorn;at ye late 
William Barker weet &thorn;at I wolde &thorn;at he made hys acompt, 
and that acompt I wolde that eythere Geffrey Spyrlyng or som other 
auditore off Norwyche, wyth John Pampyng, toke itt off hym. And as 
for any presedentys ther-off, but iff Spyrlyng ore William Berker haue 
any them-selff, ellys I cann non puruey as yitt. Neuerthelesse I suppose 
that Goodknape off Ormessby hathe owther be experyence or ellys in 
wrytyng mater j-nowe to charge hym wyth. And as for the rent in 
Rakhythe longyng to Runham, I had levere itt wer respigtyd than 
&thorn;at ther scholde as yitt be any troble for itt. I praye yow that thys 
maye be doon, and thatt Pampyng in alle hast goo her-abowt. And as for 
the costys or audytorys rewarde that schalle growe off the same, it maye 
be payed by Barker. Also that he delyuer the remenant off the mony that 
is fonde in hys hande, soo that itt maye be sent me hyddre. Also I praye 
yow remembre &thorn;e mony for Syr Thomas Lynde. The daye 
&thorn;at Master John Smythe assyngnyd is past; and sende me word by 
Juddy. I sende yow a letter by Corby wyth-in iiij dayes byffor thys, and 
therwyth ij pottys off oyle for saladys, whyche oyle was goode as myght 
be when I delyueryd itt, and schall be goode at &thorn;e reseyuyng iff it 
be nott mysse- handelyd ner mysse-karyed. Item, as for tydyng, 
the Erle off Northomberlonde is hoome in-to &thorn;e Northe, and my 
lorde off Glowcester schall afftre as to-morow, men seye. Also thys daye 
Robert off Racclyff weddyd the Lady Dymmok at my place in 
Fleetstrett, and my ladye and yowrys Dame Ely[sa]beth Bowghcher is 
weddyd to &thorn;e Lorde Howardys soone and heyre. Also Syr Thomas 
Walgraue is ded off &thorn;e syknesse &thorn;at reygnyth, on 
Tewesdaye. Now theer for yowe. Also my lorde Archebysshope was 
browt to &thorn;e Towre on Saterday at nyght, and on Mondaye at 
mydnyght he was conveyd to a schyppe and so in-to &thorn;e see, and 
as yitt I can nott vndrestande whedyre he is sent nere 

whatt is fallen off hym. Men seye &thorn;at he hathe offendyd; but as 
John Foster seythe, som men sey naye. But all hys meny are dysparblyd, 
euery man hys weye, and som &thorn;at are greete klerkys and famous 
doctorys of hys goo now ageyn to Cambrygge to scoolle. As for any 
other tydyng, I heer noon. The Cowntesse off Oxenfford is stylle in 
Seynt Martyns; I heer no worde off hyre. The Qween hadde chylde, a 
dowghter, but late at Wyndeshor; ther-off I trow ye hadde worde. And 
as for me, I am in lyke case as I was. And as for my lorde chamberleyn, 
he is nott yit comen to town. When he comythe, than schall I woote 
whatt to doo. Syr John off Parre is yowre freende and myn, and I gaffe 
hym a fayre armyng sworde wyth-in thys iij dayes. I harde somwhatt by 
hym off a bakk freende off yowrys; ye schall knowe moore here-afftre. 
Wretyn the last daye off Aprylle.
