I grete yow well and send yow Goddis blissyng and myne, letyng 
yow wete that your fermours have brought me a gret bille of reparacion, 
the which I send yow wyth lx s. in mony. I wold haue had the residue of 
the mony of them, and they said it was your agrement that this 
reparacion shuld be do and alowed now at this payment, and so I coud 
get nomore mony of them. And they say that the parson was prevy to the 
reparacion. If ye were thus agreed and woll haue the reparacion 
examined, ye may send word; but I wold ye shuld purvey for your-self 
as hastely as ye may and come home and take heed to your owne, and to 
myn therto, otherwise thanne ye haue do bifore this, bothe for my profite 
and for your; or ellis I shall purvey for my-self otherwise in hast, so that 
I trust shall be more ease and avayle for me and non ease nor pro[[fi]]te 
to yow in tyme to come. I haue litell help nor comfort of non of yow 
yet; God geve me grase to haue heraftir. I wold ye shuld assay whedir it 
be more profitable for yow to serve me thanne for to serve such masters 
as ye haue servid afore this, and that ye fynde moost profitable theraftir

knowe your-self the bettir heraftir. I pray God we may be in quyete and 
in rest wyth oure owne from hens forth. My power is nat so good as I 
wold it were for your sake and other, and if it were we shuld not longe 
be in daungere. God bryng vs oute of it, who haue yow in his kepyng. 
Wretyn wyth onhertis ease the Monday next aftir Relike Sonday. By
