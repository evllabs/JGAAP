  
To my ryght reuerend and worchepfull modyr Name Name
dwellylng at Caster, be thys delyueryd in hast. 
Ryth reuerend and worchepfull modyr, i recomand me on-to you 
as humbylly as i can thynk, desyiryng most hertly to her of youyr 
welfare and hertys ese, whyche i pray God send yow as hastyly as eny 
hert can thynk. Plesyt yow to wet &thorn;at at the makyng of thys byll 
my brodyr and i and all ouyr felawshep wer in good helle, blyssyd be 
God. As for the gydyng her in thys contr&eacute;, it is as worchepfull as 
all the world can deuyse it, and ther wer neuer Englyshe-men had so 
good cher owt of Inglond that euer i herd of. As for tydyngys her, but if 
it be of the fest i can non send yow, sauyng &thorn;at my Lady 
Margaret was maryd on Sonday last past at a towne &thorn;at is callyd 
The Dame, iij myle owt of Brugys, at v of the clok in the mornyng. And 
 
sche was browt the same day to Bruggys to hyr dener, and ther sche was 
receyuyd as worchepfully as all the world cowd deuyse, as wyth 
presessyon wyth ladys and lordys best beseyn of eny pepyll that euer i 
sye or herd of, and many pagentys wer pleyid in hyr wey in Bryggys to 
hyr welcomyng, the best &thorn;at euer i sye. And the same Sonday my 
lord the Bastard took vpon hym to answere xxiiij knytys and gentylmen 
wyth-in viij dayis at jostys of pese; and when &thorn;at they wer 
answeryd they xxiiij and hym-selue schold torney wyth othyr xxv the 
next day aftyr, whyche is on Monday next comyng. And they that haue 
jostyd wyth hym in-to thys day haue ben as rychely beseyn, and 
hym-selue also, as clothe of gold and sylk and syluyr and goldsmythys 
werk myght mak hem; for of syche ger, and gold and perle and stonys, 
they of the Dwkys coort, neythyr gentylmen nor gentylwomen, they want 
non, for wyth-owt &thorn;at they haue it by wyshys, by my trowthe i 
herd neuyr of so gret plent&eacute; as her is. Thys day my Lord Scalys 
justyd wyth a lord of thys contr&eacute;, but nat wyth the Bastard, for 
they mad promyse at London that non of them bothe schold neuer dele 
wyth othyr in armys. But the Bastard was on of the lordys &thorn;at 
browt the Lord Scalys in-to the feld, and of mysfortwne an horse strake 
my lord Bastard on the lege, and hathe hurt hym so sore that i can thynk 
he shalbe of no power to acomplyshe vp hys armys, and that is gret 
pet&eacute;, for by my trowthe i trow God mad neuer mor worchepfull 
knyt. And asfor the Dwkys coort, as of lordy[s], ladys, and 
gentylwomen, knytys, sqwyirs, and gentyllmen, i herd neuer of non lyek 
to it saue Kyng Artourys cort. By my trowthe, i haue no wyt nor 
remembrans to wryte to yow halfe the worchep that is her; but &thorn;at 
lakyth, as it comyth to mynd i shall tell yow when i come home, whyche 
i tryst to God shalnot be long to; for we depert owt of Brygys homward 
on Twysday next comyng, and all folk &thorn;at cam wyth my lady of 
Burgoyn owt of Inglond, exept syche as shall abyd her styll wyth hyr, 
whyche i wot well shall be but fewe. We depert the soner for the Dwk 
hathe word that the Frenshe Kyng is purposyd to mak wer vp-on hym 
hastyly, and that he is wythin iiij or v dayis jorney of Brugys; and the 
Dwk rydythe on Twysday next comyng forward to met wyth hym. God 
geue hym good sped, and all hys, for by my trowthe they ar the 
goodlyest felawshep tha[t] euer i cam among, and best can behaue them, 
and most lyek gentyllmen. Othyr tydyngys haue we non her, but that the 
Dwke of Somerset and all hys bend depertyd welbeseyn owt of Brugys a 
day be-for that my lady the Dwches cam thedyr; and they sey her that he 
is to Qwen Margaret &thorn;at was, and shall no mor come her a-yen 
nor be holpyn by the Dwk.  
No mor, but i beseche yow of youyr blssyng as lowly as i can, whyche i 
beseche yow forget not to geue me euery day onys. And, modyr, i 
beseche yow &thorn;at ye wolbe good mastras to my lytyll man, and to 
se &thorn;at he go to scole. I sent my cosyn Dawbeney v s. by Callys 
man for to bye for hym syche ger as he nedyth. And, modyr, i pray yow 
thys byll may recomand me to my sustyrs bothe, and to &thorn;e 
mastyr, my cosyn Dawbeney, Syr Jamys, Syr John Stylle, and to pray 
hym to be good mastyr to lytyll Jak and to lerne hym well; and i pray 
yow &thorn;at thys byll may recomand me to all youyr folkys and my 
well-wyllers. And i pray God send yow youyr hertys desyr. Wretyn at 
Bruggys the Fryday next aftyr Seynt Thomas. Your sone and humbyll
