and gadryd some sylluyr, as myche i trowe as wyll pay for ouyr costys, 
and yet i cepe here ryth a good felawschep, and mor wer promysyd me 
whyche &thorn;at came not to me, wherby i was ner deseyuyd; for when 
Debnam herd sey how &thorn;at i began to gadyr syluyr he reysyd many 
men wyth-in j daye and an halfe, to &thorn;e nombyr of iijc men, as i 
was credebly assartaynyd by a yeman of &thorn;e chambyr of my lordys

ouyr pertyes, wheche wer a gret dysworchep to my lord, consederyng 
how &thorn;at he takyth vs bothe for hys men and so we be knowyn 
well j-now; vpon whyche jnformacion and dysworchep to my lord 
&thorn;at tweyn of hys men schold debat so ner hym, contrary to 
&thorn;e Kyngys pese, consedryd of my lord and lady and ther 
cownsell, my lord sent for me and Syr Gylberd Debnam to come to hym 
to Framlyngham bothe. And as it fortunyd well, my modyr come to me

&thorn;at we schold neythyr gadyr no felawschep, but syche men as we

coort schold be contenuyd in-to the tyme &thorn;at my lord, or syche as 
he wold asyngne, had spok bothe wyth yow and Yeluerton and Jenney, 
and &thorn;at on jndeferent man chosyn by us bothe schold be assynyd 
to kep the plase in-to &thorn;e tyme &thorn;at ye and they wer spook 
wyth. And then i answ[er]ed my lord and seyd how &thorn;at at that 
tyme i had my mastyr wyth-in &thorn;e maner of Cotton, whyche was 
my modyr, and in-to the tyme &thorn;at i had spook wyth hyr i cowd 
geue none answer; and so my lord sent Rychard Fulmerston, berer 
her-of, to my modyr thys day for an answer, whyche answer he schold 
bryng to my lord to London, for my lord rod to Londonward as 
yesterday, and &thorn;e soner be-cause he trustyd to haue a good end of 
&thorn;is mater and alle othyr be-twyx yow, whyche he takyth for a gret 
worchep to hym ward and a gret auantage bothe and he cowd bryng 
&thorn;is mater abowt; for then he wold trust to haue youyr seruyse 
alle, whyche wer to hym gret tresour and auantage. And &thorn;is was 
the answer &thorn;at my modyr and i gaue hym, &thorn;at at &thorn;e 
instans of my lord and my ladye we wold do &thorn;us myche as for to 
put &thorn;e coort in contenuans and no more to receyue of &thorn;e 
profytys of &thorn;e maner than we had, and had dystresid for, tyll in-to 
&thorn;e tym that sche and i had word ayen fro my lord and yow if so 
wer &thorn;at &thorn;ey wold neythyr mak entreys nor dystreyn the 
tenauntys nor cepe no coort more then we wold do; and we told Rychard 
Fulmerston that thys my modyr and i ded at &thorn;e jnstans and gret 
request of my lord because  
my lord intendyd pes, whyche resonably we wold not be ayenst, and yet 
we seyd we knew well &thorn;at we schold haue no thank of yow when 
ye knew of it wyth-owt it wer be-cause we ded it at my lordys jnstans. 
But be-for thys answer we had receyvyd as myche syluyr full nye as 
Rychard Calle sent vs bokys of for to gadyr yt bye, and as for &thorn;e

same, for it was tyme for hym to sey so for my lord told hym &thorn;at 
he wold set hym fast by the feet ellys to be suyr of hym &thorn;at he 
schold make non jnsurreccions in-to &thorn;e tyme &thorn;at my lord 
came ayen fro London. I wene, and so dothe my modyr bothe, &thorn;at 
thys appoyntment was mad in good tyme, for i was deseyuyd of bettyr
