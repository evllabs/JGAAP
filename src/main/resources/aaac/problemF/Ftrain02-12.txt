  
TO JOHN PASTON III 1473,  06, 
03  
To John Paston, esquiere, be thys delyueryd. 
Ryght wyrshypffull brother, I comand me to yow, latyng yow weet 
&thorn;at thys daye I was in verry purpose to Caleys warde, all redy to 
haue goon to &thorn;e barge, saff I teryed for a yonge man &thorn;at I 
thoght to haue had wyth me thyddre, on that was wyth Rows whyche is 
in the cowntr&eacute;. And becawse I cowde not geet hym, and 
&thorn;at I have nomore here wyth me butt Pampyng, Edward, and Jak, 
therffor Pampyng remembryd me that at Caleys he tolde me &thorn;at 
he purposyd to be wyth the Duchesse off Norffolk, my lady and yowrys; 
and Edward is syke and semythe nott abydyng---he wolde  see what 
shold falle off thys worlde. And so I am as he that seythe, 'com hyddre, 
John, my men'. And as happe was yisterday Juddy went a-fore to 
Caleysward, wherffor I am nowe ille purueyd, whyche for owte 
&thorn;at i knowe yit is lyke to kepe me heere thys Wytsontyd. 
Wherffor, iff ye knowe any lykly men and fayre condycioned and good 
archerys, sende hem to me, thowe it be iiij, and I wyll have them and 
they shall haue iiij m[a]rke by yere and my lever&eacute;. He maye com 
to me hyddre to &thorn;e Gott, or yit to Caleys, wyth a riall iff he be 
wyse, whyche iff nede bee I wolde &thorn;at Berkere toke hym to com 
vppe wyth, iff it be suche on as ye tryst. Item, I suppose bothe 
Pytte and Kothye Plattyng shall goo from me in hast. I wyll neuer 
cherysshe knaves soo as I have don for ther sakys. Item, I praye 
yow sende me a newe vestment off whyght damaske fore a dekyn, 
whyche is among myn other geer at Norwyche, for he shall ther-too as 
ye woot off. I wyll make an armyng doblett off it, thow I sholde an 
other tyme gyff a longe gown off velwett fore an other vestment; and 
send it in all hast to Hoxon to send me. I hopyd to have been verry mery 
at Caleys thys Whytsontyd, and am weell apparayled and apoyntyd saff 
that thes folkys fayle me soo; and I have mater there to make off ryght 
excellent. Som man wolde have hastyd hym to Caleys thowe he had hadd 
no better erand, and som men thynke it wysdom and profyght to be theer 
now, weell owt off the weye.  
Item, as for the Bysshop and I, we bee nerre to a poynt than we 
weere, so that my part is nowe all the londes in Flegge holly, the maner 
off Heylesdon, Tolthorpe, and ten[emen]tys in Norwyche and Erlham 
excepte Fayrechyldys; but farweell Drayton, the devyll doytt them! 
Item, large and ferre comynycacion hathe ben bytwyen Syr John 
Fogge, Richard Hawlte, fore ther suster and me, byffore Doctore 
Wynterborne and ellys where, so that I am in better hope than I was by 
Seynt Lawrens that I shall haue a delyueraunce. Item, as for 
tydyngys heer, I trow ye have herde yowre parte howe &thorn;at 
&thorn;e Erle off Oxenfford londyd at Seynt Osyes in Esexe &thorn;e 
xxviij daye off Maye, saff he teryed nott longe; for iff he hadd the Erle 
off Essexe rod to hym wardys, and the lordys Denham and Durasse and 
other more, whyche by lyklyod sholde have dystrussyd hym. But yit hys 
comyng savyd Hogan hys hed, and hys profesye is the more belevyd, for 
he seyde that this troble sholde begyn in Maye, and &thorn;at the Kyng 
sholde northwardys and that &thorn;e Scottys sholde make vs werke and 
hym batayle. Men loke afftre they wot not what, but men by harneys 
fast. The Kyngys menyall men and &thorn;e Duke off Clarauncys are 
many in thys town; &thorn;e Lord Ryuerse com to-daye, me[n] sey to 
purueye in lyke wyse. Item, how &thorn;at &thorn;e Cowntesse 
off Warwyk is now owt off Beweley seynt- warye, and Syr James Tyrell 
conveyth hyre northwarde, men seye by the Kynges assent, wherto som 
men seye &thorn;at the Duke of Clarance is not agreyd.  Item, men seye 
&thorn;at the Erle off Oxenfford is abowt the jlde off Tenett hoveryng, 
som seye wyth grett companye and som seye wyth fewe. No more, but 
God kepe yow. Wretyn at London the iij daye off June ao E. iiijti xiijo.
