  
Syr, plesyth it to vndyrstand that i conceyue by your lettyr whyche 
&thorn;at ye sent me by Jwd&eacute; &thorn;at ye haue herd of R.C 
labor whyche he makyth by ouyr vngracyous sustyrs assent; but wher as 
they wryet that they haue my good wyll ther-in, sauyng your reuerence 
&thorn;ey falsly lye of it, for they neuer spake to me of &thorn;at 
mater, nor non othyr body in ther name. Louell axyd me onys a 
qwestyon whedyr &thorn;at i vndyrstood how it was betwyx R. C. and 
my sustyr. I can thynk &thorn;at it was by Callys menys, for when i 
axyd hym whedyr C. desyird hym to meue me &thorn;at qwestyon or 
not, he wold haue gotyn it aweye by hummys and by hays. But i wold 
not so be answeryd, wherfor at &thorn;e last he told me &thorn;at hys 
oldest sone desyird hym to spere whedyr &thorn;at R. C. wer swyr of 
hyr or nowt, for he seyd &thorn;at he knew a good maryage for hyr. But 
i wot he lyeyd, for he is hole wyth R. Cale in &thorn;at mater; 
wher-for, to &thorn;at entent &thorn;at he nor they shold pyek no 
comfort of me, i answerd hym &thorn;at and my fadyr, whom God 
asoyle, wer a-lyue and had consentyd ther-to, and my modyr and ye 
bothe, he shold neuer haue my good wyll for to make my sustyr to selle 
kandyll and mustard in Framly[n]gham; and &thorn;us, wythe mor 
wyhche wer longe to wryet to you, we departyd.  
And wher as it plesythe yow in your lettyr to crye me mercy for 
&thorn;at ye sent me not syche ger as i sent yow mony for, i crye yow 
mercy &thorn;at i was so lewde to encomber yow wyth eny so sympyll a 
mater, consyderyng the grette maters and weyghty &thorn;at ye haue to 
doo; but need compellyd me, for in thys contr&eacute; is no syche stuffe 
as i sent to yow for. Also, wher as it plesyth yow to send to Rychard 
Calle to delyuer me monye, so God help me i wyll non axe hym for 
my-sylfe, nor non had i of hym, nor of non othyr man but of myne 
owne, syne ye depertyd; but &thorn;at lytyll &thorn;at i myght for-bere 
of myn owne i haue delyueryd to Dawbeney for howsold, and payd it for 
yow in menys wagys. And ther-for who euer sendys yow word &thorn;at 
i haue spent yow eny mony syne ye went hens, they must geue yow an 
othyr reknyng, in sauyng in met and drynk, for i eete lyek an horse of 
purpose to eete yow owte at the dorys; but &thorn;at nedythe not, for ye 
com not wyth-in them, whe[r]for, so God help me, the felaushep her 
thynkys  &thorn;at ye haue forgetyn vs alle. Wherfor, and eny thyng be 
ille rewlyd when ye come home, wyet it your-selfe for defawt of 
ouer-syght. Also i vndyrstand for verry se[r]teyn, and it is sent me so 
woord owt of my lordys howse, that thys Pentcost is my lordys consell 
at Framlyngham, and they purpose thys week and the next to hold 
coortys her at Caster and at all othyr maners &thorn;at wer Syr John F., 
purchasyd of Yelluerton and of Syr T. H., whom God asoyle; and how 
that my demenyng shalbe it is to late to send to yow for auyse, 
wherfo[[r]] and i do well i axe no thank and if i do ille i pray yow ley 
the defawt on ouyr lytyll wyte. But i purpose to vse the fyrst poynt of 
hawkyng, to hold fast and i maye; but so God help me, and they myht 
pulle downe &thorn;e howse on ouyr hedys i wyet hem not, whyche i 
trust to God to kep hem from. For, by God that bowght me, the best erle 
in Inglond wold not dele so wyth my lord and my lady as ye do 
wyth-owt makyng of some menys to them; so God help me, who so euer 
auyse yow to do so, he is not your frend. And i may, i tryst to God to se 
yow a-bowght Mydsomer or be-for, for in good feythe i wene ye 
purpose yow &thorn;at it shall be Estern er ye come hom; for all your 
seruauntys her wen that ye purpose no more to dele wyth them, but to 
leue hem her in ostage to my lord of Norfolk. A[l]so, syr, i pray yow 
puruey what jne &thorn;at my brodyr Edmu[n]d shall be in, for he 
losyth sore tyme her, i promyse yow. I pray yow send me word by the 
next messenger &thorn;at comyth, and i shall eythyr send hym or bryng 
hym vp wyth me to London.  
Also, syr, we pore sanz deners of Caster haue brook iij or iij stelle 
bowys; wherfor we beseche yow, and ther be eny maker of steelle bowys 
jn London whyche is verry kunnyng, &thorn;at ye wyll send me woord, 
and i shall send yow the bowys &thorn;at be brokyn, whyche be your 
owne greet bowe and Roberd Jaksonys bowe and Johon Pampyng[[ys] 
bowe. Thes iij haue kast so many caluys &thorn;at they shall neuer cast 
qwarellys tyll they be new mad. I praye yow fynd the menys that my 
lord may haue some resonable meane profyrd so &thorn;at he and my 
lady may vndyrstand that ye desyir to haue hys good lordshep. I promyse 
yow jt shall do yow ease, and your tenauntys both. And God preserue.
