  
TO JOHN PASTON I 1464,  06, 
02  
Ryth reuerent and worchepfull fadyr, i recomand me on-to yow, 
bes[e]chyng yow lowly of youyr blyssyng. Plesit yow to haue knowlage 
how &thorn;at i haue be in Sowthefolk for syche materys as my cosyn 
Dawbeney took my modyr a byll of towchyng the materys be-twyx yow 
and Jenney, and of all the jentylmen that ye wold my modyr schold send 
to for thys mater ther ar no more at home bot John Aly[n]gton; and i 
schewyd hym the byll of the namys of the jnqwest, and [he] knew no 
more of hem all bot thes: John Depden, Thomas Wodborne, John 
Donemowe, Herry Chesten, and Adam Wrene. And to all them 
Aly[n]gton sent a man of hys for to fele  
hem how they wer dysposyd. Thys was the answer of John Depden and 
Thomas Wodborne: they seyd the last tyme they wer at London iche of 
ther costys stood hem on x s., and they seyd they wold no mor come at 
London bot if they knew who schod pay for ther costys; bot me thowt by 
Alyngtonys man that they wold haue had a brybe of yow, be-syd 
&thorn;e paying for ther issuys, for to haue bedyn at home, for they 
haue non othyr leuyng but brybys. As for John Donemow and Herry 
Chesten, so that ther issuys may be payd they wyll not come ther, nor in 
trowthe they schall not come ther; wher-for Aly[n]gton prayith yow 
&thorn;at ther issuys may be payid. Adam Wrene was not spok to, for 
he is Jenneys baly or hys fermour. As for the quest, they are not yet 
somonyd to aper, and but if they be somonyd &thorn;er schall non of 
hem all aper. The most part of the todyr dwell a-bowt Ippyswyche, and 
they be Debnamys tenauntys and Brewsys; and i kowd get no man to 
spek wyth hem but if i schold haue spok wyth hem myselue, and my 
spekyng wyth hem schold rather apeyryd the mater than a-mendyd it. 
And also i hyid me the faster home a-geyn for i lay at my cosyn 
Louedays on Corpus Cristi Day at nyth, and he told me that the Duches 
of Sofokys consell wold entre in-to Calcot Hall, and they wold kep it tyll 
the Duches knew who schold be her tenaunt, owthyr ye or Debnam. 
Thus told on of the men of the seyd cowncell to Loueday, whyche man 
schold ryd thedyr wyth hem, and thys schold be do as to-morow at aftyr 
non; bot i trow they wole but tak a distres for the seruys of the maner 
whyche is dwe, but i haue sent word to Rysyng and to the tenauntys that 
they schold dryue a-wey ther catell. And as for the maner, my brodyr 
and i schall kepe it so &thorn;at they schall not entyr as that daye, by 
the grase of God, nor aftyr nowthyr and we may knowe of it, but if ye 
send vs othyr-wys word. As for the namys that ye wold haue for to pase 
vpon the mater betwyx yow and Hogan, i spak to Aly[n]gton and 
Loueday ther-of, and Loueday seyd he knew non &thorn;at wold pas 
vp-on ony jnquest for hym, for he medylyd wyth no syche men; and 
Alyngton seyd that he kowd assyne me non men for serteyn, not tyll he 
had spok wyth some, whyche he seyd wold aske gret leyser for he knew 
bot fewe in Sofolk - if it had be in Cambryge-schyre he kowd haue get 
yow j-now. My modyr spak wyth old Banyard of Sibton Abbey for the 
same mater, and he knew non &thorn;at wold pase vpon &thorn;e mater 
at his desyir, but he asygnyd dyuers men &thorn;at loue not Jeney, 
whyche he kowd thynk wold pase vpon it at yowr desyir if ye spak wyth 
hem youyrselue or at &thorn;e lest iche of hem kowd get yow ij or iij 
men that wold sey as they wold in cas ye spak wyth hem youyr-selue, 
whoys namys i send yow in a byll by Loueday.  
Item, as for &thorn;e gape at Nakton, Rychard Call seyth that it 
was a thorn busche was leyd in wyth-owt a stake be-twyx ij thornys 
&thorn;at grew; and as for Jeneys net, ther was not on lost her calfe that 
i can jnquer of. And i pray God forther yow in all youyr materys to hys 
plesans and to youyr hertys desyir. Wretyn in hast at Hallysworthe the 
Saterday next aftyr Trinit&eacute; Sonday. My cosyn Heueny[n]gham is 
at London, and he kowd asygne yow men that wold sey as he wold, mor 
than Syr John Wy[n]gfeld, Aly[n]gton, and all. youyr sone and lowly 
seruant John Paston &thorn;e yongest
