  
TO JOHN PASTON I 1465,  05, 
03  
To my ryght wyrshypffull husbond John Paston be thys delyueryd 
in hast.  

Ryght wyrshypful husbond, I recomaunde me vn-to you. Pleasyd 
you to wyte that I have spoken thys wyke wyth dyuers of youre 
tenauntys of Drayton and put hem in confort that all shalbe well 
heraftere, by the grace of God; and I fyle well by hem that they wylbe 
ryght glad to haue ayen there olde mayster, and so wold they all except j 
or ij that be fals shrewys. And thys next wyke I purpose on Wensday or 
Thursday to be at Haylesdon and to a-byde ther a wyke or ij and send 
oure men a-bovte to gedere money at Drayton and Haylesdon, and yf ye 
wyll I woll do kepe a corte at Drayton or I com thens. I pray you send 
me word how ye wyll that I doo there-in. I recevyd ij letters from you of 
Nicholl Colman yestere-day, wer-in ye desyre that we shuld purvey for 
your malte and barley, and soo shall we doo as well as we cann and send 
you word howe that we may doo there-wyth in hast. Item, 
yester-day Maister Phylyp toke Dorletys hors vppon Drayton lond as 
they went to the plowe, for the hol[[e]] yere ferm; and, as it ys told me, 
the tenauntys of Drayton told hym that he dyde hym wrong to make hym 
pay for the hole yere, for non of the tenauntys had payd hym but for the 
di. yere. And he say[d] thohg they hadnot payd but for the di. yere 
Paston shuld pay for the othere di. yere, and for moo yerys also yf he 
lyvyd. But I trow to gyte Dorlet a-yen hys hors, or els Maister Phylyp ys 
lyke to be vn-horssyd ons, and we lyve all. Youre son shall com hom to 
moryn, as I trowe, and as he deme[n]yth hym hyre-aftere I shall lete you 
haue knowlych; and I pray you thynk not in me that I wyll supporte hym 
ne fauour hym in no lewdnesse, for I wylnot. As I fynd hym here-aftere 
soo I wyll lete you haue knowlych. I haue put youre evydens that com 
owte of the abbay in a seck, and enseylyd hem vndere Richard Call ys 
seall, that he shalnot say but they eryn as he left hem. But as for the
