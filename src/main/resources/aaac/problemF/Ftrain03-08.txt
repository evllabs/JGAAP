To my mastyr Syr John Paston logyng in Fletstret be thys 
delyueryd.  

Syr, lyekyth it yow to wet &thorn;at thys day my modyr sent me 
your lettyrs, wer-by i vndy[r]stand, blessyd be God, all thyng standyth in 
good wey. Also i vndyrstand by your lettyr sent to my modyr and me 
&thorn;at ye wold haue your lyuelod gadyrd as hastyly as we myght do 
it. Syr, as to that, and othyr folk do no wers ther deuer in gaderyng of 
othyr manerys then we haue don in Caster, i tryst to God that ye schall 
not be long vnpayid; for thys day we had in the last comb of barly that 
eny man owyth in Caster towne, not wyth standyng Hew Awstyn and 
hys men hathe crakyd many a gret woord in the tym &thorn;at it hathe 
ben in gaderyng. And twenty comb Hew Awstyns man had don cartyd, 
redy for to haue led it to Yermowth, and when i herd ther-of i let slype a 
sertyn of whelpys, that gaue the cart and the barly syche a torn 
&thorn;at it was fayne to tak couert in your bakhous systern at Caster 
Halle; and it was wet wyth-in an owyr aftyr &thorn;at it cam hom, and 
is nye redy to mak of good malt ale, ho ho. William Yeluerton hathe ben 
at Gwton, and hathe set in a new bayly ther and hathe dystreynyd the 
tenauntys, and hathe gen hem day tyll Candyllmas to pay syche mony as 
he axyth of hem. Also the seyd Yelluerton hathe ben at Saxthorp, and 
hathe dystreynyd the fermour ther and takyn of hym swert&eacute; to 
paye hym. And thys day the seyd Yeluerton and viij men wyth hym, 
wyth jakys and trossyng dobletys all &thorn;e felawshep of hem, wer 
redy to ryd, and on of the sam felawshep told to a man that sye hem all 
redy &thorn;at they shold ryd to tak a dystres in serteyn maners 
&thorn;at wer Syr John Fastolffys. Wher-for i suppose veryly that they 
be to Gwton and Saxthorp, wher-for to-morow i purpose to send 
Dawbeney thedyr to wet what they do, and to comand the tenauntys and 
fermors that they pay no mony to no body bot to yow. John Grey, 
othyrwyse callyd John de les Bay, and John Burgeys, they be Yeluertons 
kapteyns, and they ryd and go dayly, as well in Norwyche as in othyr 
plasys of yours and othyr menys in the contr&eacute;, in ther trossyng 
dowbelettys. wyth bombardys and kanonys and chaseueleyns, and do 
what so euer they wyll in the contr&eacute;. Ther dar no pore man 
dy[s]plese theym, for what so euyr they do wyth ther swordys they make 
it lawe, and they tak dystressys owt of menys howsys, horse or catell or 
what they wyll, thow it be not on that fee that they ask the dwt&eacute; 
for. Wher-for me thynkys wyth esy menys ye myth get a preuy seall of 
the Kyng to be dyrectyd to the meyir of Norwyche, as for the towne of 
Norwyche, and for the contr&eacute; a-nothyr preu&eacute; seall dyrect

alegeans to execut &thorn;e Kyngys comandment. And thys done i 
warant your lyuelod &thorn;at my lord delys not wyth shall be gadyrd 
pesybylly. As to &thorn;at lyuelod &thorn;at my lord clemys, i schall do
