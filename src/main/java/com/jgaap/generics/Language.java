 * new class in the com.jgaap.languages package that extends
 * com.jgaap.generics.Language all that you need is to send the constructor to
 * the super class specifying the name - how users will see the language
 * displayed, language - the way the internal system and other classes will view
 * the language (all lowercase), and the charset- the character set you will
 * read in when working with this language. If the language you are working with
 * requires pre-processing before it is handed off to jgaap that can be defined
 * in the parse method you can choose to override. If you are doing parsing you
 * MUST add super.setParseable(true) to your constructor.
